As their names indicate, the\n:before and :after pseudo-elements specify the location of content\nbefore and after an element's [document\ntree](conform.html#doctree) content. The ['content'](generate.html#propdef-content)\nproperty, in conjunction with these pseudo-elements, specifies what is\ninserted.\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, the following rule inserts the string \"Note: \"\nbefore the content of \nevery P element whose \"class\" attribute has the value \"note\":\n\n```\n\np.note:before { content: \"Note: \" }\n\n```\n\nThe formatting objects (e.g., boxes) generated by an element include\ngenerated content. So, for example, changing the above style sheet\nto:\n\n```\n\np.note:before { content: \"Note: \" }\np.note { border: solid green }\n\n```\n\nwould cause a solid green border to be rendered around the entire\nparagraph, including the initial string.\n\nThe :before and :after pseudo-elements [inherit](cascade.html#inheritance) any inheritable properties\nfrom the element in the document tree to which they are attached.\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, the following rules insert an open quote mark before every\nQ element. The color of the quote mark will be red, but the font will\nbe the same as the font of the rest of the Q element:\n\n```\n\nq:before {\n content: open-quote;\n color: red\n}\n\n```\n\nIn a :before or :after pseudo-element declaration, non-inherited\nproperties take their [initial\nvalues](about.html#initial-value).\n\nExample(s):\n\nSo, for example, because the initial value of the ['display'](visuren.html#propdef-display) property is 'inline', the\nquote in the previous example is inserted as an inline box (i.e.,\non the same line as the element's initial text content).\nThe next example explicitly sets the \n['display'](visuren.html#propdef-display) property to\n'block', so that the inserted text becomes a block:\n\n```\n\nbody:after {\n content: \"The End\";\n display: block;\n margin-top: 2em;\n text-align: center;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe :before and :after pseudo-elements interact with other\nboxes as if they were real elements inserted just\ninside their associated element.\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, the following document fragment and style sheet:\n\n```\n\n<p> Text </p> p:before { display: block; content: 'Some'; }\n\n```\n\n...would render in exactly the same way as the following document\nfragment and style sheet:\n\n```\n\n<p><span>Some</span> Text </p> span { display: block }\n\n```\n\nSimilarly, the following document fragment and style sheet:\n\n```\n\n<h2> Header </h2> h2:after { display: block; content: 'Thing'; }\n\n```\n\n...would render in exactly the same way as the following document\nfragment and style sheet:\n\n```\n\n<h2> Header <span>Thing</span></h2> h2 { display: block; }\n span { display: block; }\n\n```\n\nNote. This specification does not fully define the interaction of :before\nand :after with replaced elements (such as IMG in HTML). This will\nbe defined in more detail in a future specification.",

The latter\nfunction also has two forms: 'counters(name,\nstring)' or 'counters(name, string,\nstyle)'. The generated text is the value of all counters\nwith the given name in scope at this pseudo-element, from outermost to\ninnermost separated by the specified string. The counters are rendered\nin the indicated [style](#counter-styles) ('decimal' by\ndefault). See the section on [automatic counters\nand numbering](#counters) for more information.\n\nThe name must not be 'none', 'inherit' or 'initial'.

The\ncase-sensitivity of attribute names depends on the document language. \n\nNote. In CSS 2.2, it is not possible to refer to\nattribute values for other elements than the subject of the selector.\n\nThe ['display'](visuren.html#propdef-display) property\ncontrols whether the content is placed in a block or inline box.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following rule causes the string \"Chapter: \" to be generated before each H1 element:\n\n```\n\nH1:before { \n content: \"Chapter: \";\n display: inline;\n}\n\n```\n\nAuthors may include newlines in the generated content by writing\nthe \"\\A\" escape sequence in one of the strings after the ['content'](generate.html#propdef-content) property.

If the depth is 0, the first pair is\nused, if the depth is 1, the second pair is used, etc. If the depth is\ngreater than the number of pairs, the last pair is repeated. A 'close-quote'\nor 'no-close-quote' that would make the depth negative is in error and is\nignored (at rendering time): the depth stays at 0 and no quote mark is\nrendered (although the rest of the 'content' property's value is still\ninserted).\n\nNote.

Zero and negative integers are allowed.\n\nThe ['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset)\nproperty also contains a list of one or more names of counters, each\none optionally followed by an integer. The integer gives the value that\nthe counter is set to on each occurrence of the element. The default\nis 0.\n\nThe keywords 'none', 'inherit' and 'initial' must not be used as\ncounter names. A value of 'none' on its own means no counters are\nreset, resp. incremented. 'Inherit' on its own has its usual meaning\n(see [6.2.1](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)). 'Initial' is\nreserved for future use.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThis example shows a way to number chapters and sections with\n\"Chapter 1\", \"1.1\", \"1.2\", etc.\n\n```\n\nBODY {\n counter-reset: chapter; /* Create a chapter counter scope */\n}\nH1:before {\n content: \"Chapter \" counter(chapter) \". \";\n counter-increment: chapter; /* Add 1 to chapter */\n}\nH1 {\n counter-reset: section; /* Set section to 0 */\n}\nH2:before {\n content: counter(chapter) \".\" counter(section) \" \";\n counter-increment: section;\n}\n\n```\n\nIf an element increments/resets a counter and also uses it (in the\n['content'](generate.html#propdef-content) property of its\n:before or :after pseudo-element), the counter is used after\nbeing incremented/reset.\n\nIf an element both resets and increments a counter, the counter is\nreset first and then incremented.\n\nIf the same counter is specified more than once in the value of the\n['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset) and ['counter-increment'](generate.html#propdef-counter-increment)\nproperties, each reset/increment of the counter is processed in the order\nspecified.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following example will reset the 'section' counter to 0:\n\n```\n\nH1 { counter-reset: section 2 section }\n\n```\n\nThe following example will increment the 'chapter' counter by 3:\n\n```\n\nH1 { counter-increment: chapter chapter 2 }\n\n```\n\nThe ['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset)\nproperty follows the cascading rules.

This is important for situations like lists\nin HTML, where elements can be nested inside themselves to arbitrary\ndepth. It would be impossible to define uniquely named counters for\neach level.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThus, the following suffices to number nested list items. The\nresult is very similar to that of setting 'display:list-item' and\n'list-style: inside' on the LI element:\n\n```\n\nOL { counter-reset: item }\nLI { display: block }\nLI:before { content: counter(item) \". \"; counter-increment: item }\n\n```\n\nThe **scope**\nof a counter starts at the first element in the document that has a\n['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset) for that\ncounter and includes the element's descendants and its following\nsiblings with their descendants. However, it does not include any\nelements in the scope of a counter with the same name created by a 'counter-reset' on a\nlater sibling of the element or by a later 'counter-reset' on the same\nelement.\n\nIf ['counter-increment'](generate.html#propdef-counter-increment) or ['content'](generate.html#propdef-content) on an element or\npseudo-element refers to a counter that is not in the scope of any\n['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset),\nimplementations should behave as though a ['counter-reset'](generate.html#propdef-counter-reset) had reset the\ncounter to 0 on that element or pseudo-element.\n\nIn the example above, an OL will create a counter, and all children\nof the OL will refer to that counter.\n\n If we denote by item[n] the\nnth instance of the \"item\"\ncounter, and by \"{\" and \"}\" the beginning and end of a\nscope, then the following HTML fragment will use the indicated\ncounters. (We assume the style sheet as given in the example above).\n\n```\n\n<OL> <!-- {item[0]=0 -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[0]++ (=1) -->\n <LI>item <!-- item[0]++ (=2) -->\n <OL> <!-- {item[1]=0 -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[1]++ (=1) -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[1]++ (=2) -->\n <LI>item <!-- item[1]++ (=3) -->\n <OL> <!-- {item[2]=0 -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[2]++ (=1) -->\n </OL> <!-- -->\n <OL> <!-- }{item[2]=0 -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[2]++ (=1) -->\n </OL> <!-- -->\n </LI> <!-- } -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[1]++ (=4) -->\n </OL> <!-- -->\n </LI> <!-- } -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[0]++ (=3) -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[0]++ (=4) -->\n</OL> <!-- -->\n<OL> <!-- }{item[0]=0 -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[0]++ (=1) -->\n <LI>item</LI> <!-- item[0]++ (=2) -->\n</OL> <!-- -->\n\n```\n\nExample(s):\n\nAnother example, showing how scope works when counters are used on\nelements that are not nested, is the following.

Their exact\nrendering depends on the user agent.\n\nNumbering systems are specified with:\n\ndecimalDecimal numbers, beginning with 1.\n\ndecimal-leading-zero\nDecimal numbers padded by initial zeros (e.g., 01, 02, 03, ..., 98, 99).\n\nlower-roman\nLowercase roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.).\n\nupper-roman\nUppercase roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, etc.).\n\ngeorgian\nTraditional Georgian numbering \n(an, ban, gan, ..., he, tan, in, in-an, ...).\narmenian\nTraditional uppercase Armenian numbering.\n\nAlphabetic systems are specified with:\n\nlower-latin or lower-alpha\nLowercase ascii letters (a, b, c, ... z).\nupper-latin or upper-alpha\nUppercase ascii letters (A, B, C, ... Z).\nlower-greek\nLowercase classical Greek \nalpha, beta, gamma, ... (α, β, γ, ...)\n\nThis specification does not define how alphabetic systems wrap at\nthe end of the alphabet. For instance, after 26 list items,\n'lower-latin' rendering is undefined. Therefore, for long lists, we\nrecommend that authors specify true numbers.\n\nCSS 2.2 does not define how the list numbering is reset and\nincremented. This is expected to be defined in the CSS List Module\n[[CSS3LIST]](refs.html#ref-CSS3LIST).\n\nFor example, the following HTML document:\n\n```\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">\n<HTML>\n <HEAD>\n <TITLE>Lowercase latin numbering</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n ol { list-style-type: lower-roman } \n </STYLE>\n </HEAD>\n <BODY>\n <OL>\n <LI> This is the first item.\n <LI> This is the second item.\n <LI> This is the third item.\n </OL>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n```\n\nmight produce something like this:\n\n```\n\n i This is the first item.\n ii This is the second item.\niii This is the third item.\n\n```\n\nThe list marker alignment (here, right justified) depends on the user agent.\n\n \n \n Name:\n **list-style-image**Value:[<uri>](syndata.html#value-def-uri) | none | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:none\nApplies to:elements with 'display: list-item'\nInherited:yes\nPercentages:N/A\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:absolute URI or 'none'\n\n This property sets the image that will be used as the list item\nmarker. When the image is available, it will replace the marker set\nwith the ['list-style-type'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-type) marker.\n\nThe size of the image is calculated from the following rules:\n\nIf the image has an intrinsic width and height, the used width and\nheight are the intrinsic width and height.\n\nOtherwise, if the image has an intrinsic ratio and either an\nintrinsic width or an intrinsic height, the used width/height is the\nsame as the provided intrinsic width/height, and the used value of the\nmissing dimension is calculated from the provided dimension and the\nratio.\n\nOtherwise, if the image has an intrinsic ratio, the used width is\n1em and the used height is calculated from this width and the\nintrinsic ratio. If this would produce a height larger than 1em, then\nthe used height is instead set to 1em and the used width is calculated\nfrom this height and the intrinsic ratio.\n\nOtherwise, the image's used width is its intrinsic width if it has\none, or else 1em. The image's used height is its intrinsic height if\nit has one, or else 1em.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following example sets the marker at the beginning of each list\nitem to be the image \"ellipse.png\".\n\n```\n\nul { list-style-image: url(\"http://png.com/ellipse.png\") }\n\n```\n\n \n \n Name:\n **list-style-position**Value:inside | outside | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:outside\nApplies to:elements with 'display: list-item'\nInherited:yes\nPercentages:N/A\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:as specified\n\n This property specifies the position of the marker box with\nrespect to the\nprincipal block box. Values have the following meanings:\n\noutside\n\nThe marker box is outside the principal block box. The\nposition of the list-item marker adjacent to floats is undefined in\nCSS 2.2. CSS 2.2 does not specify the precise\nlocation of the marker box or its position in the painting\norder, but does\nrequire that for list items whose 'direction' property is 'ltr' the\nmarker box be on the left side of the content and for elements whose\n'direction' property is 'rtl' the marker box be on the right side of\nthe content.\n\nThe marker box is fixed with respect to the principal block box's\nborder and does not scroll with the principal block box's content.\n\nIn CSS 2.2, a UA may hide the marker if\nthe element's ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) is other\nthan 'visible'. (This is expected to change in the future.)\n\nThe size or contents of the marker box may affect the height of the\nprincipal block box and/or the height of its first line box, and in\nsome cases may cause the creation of a new line box. Note: This interaction may be more\nprecisely defined in a future level of CSS.\n\ninside\n\nThe marker box is placed as the first inline box in the principal\nblock box, before the element's content and before any :before\npseudo-elements. CSS 2.2 does not specify\nthe precise location of the marker box.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\n<HTML>\n <HEAD>\n <TITLE>Comparison of inside/outside position</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n ul { list-style: outside }\n ul.compact { list-style: inside }\n </STYLE>\n </HEAD>\n <BODY>\n <UL>\n <LI>first list item comes first\n <LI>second list item comes second\n </UL>\n\n <UL class=\"compact\">\n <LI>first list item comes first\n <LI>second list item comes second\n </UL>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n```\n\n The above example may be formatted as:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/list-inout-desc.html)\n\nIn right-to-left text, the markers would have been on the right\nside of the box. \n\n \n \n Name:\n **list-style**Value:[ [<'list-style-type'>](generate.html#propdef-list-style-type) || [<'list-style-position'>](generate.html#propdef-list-style-position) || [<'list-style-image'>](generate.html#propdef-list-style-image) ] | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:see individual properties\nApplies to:elements with 'display: list-item'\nInherited:yes\nPercentages:N/A\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:see individual properties\n\n The ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) property\nis a shorthand notation for setting the three properties ['list-style-type'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-type), ['list-style-image'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-image), and ['list-style-position'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-position) at\nthe same place in the style sheet.\n\nExample(s):\n\n```\n\nul { list-style: upper-roman inside } /* Any \"ul\" element */\nul > li > ul { list-style: circle outside } /* Any \"ul\" child \n of an \"li\" child \n of a \"ul\" element */\n\n```\n\nAlthough authors may specify ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) information directly\non list item elements (e.g., \"li\" in HTML), they should do so with\ncare. The following rules look similar, but the first declares a [descendant selector](./selector.html#descendant-selectors)\nand the second a (more specific) [child\nselector.](./selector.html#child-selectors)\n\n```\n\nol.alpha li { list-style: lower-alpha } /* Any \"li\" descendant of an \"ol\" */ \nol.alpha > li { list-style: lower-alpha } /* Any \"li\" child of an \"ol\" */\n\n```\n\nAuthors who use only the [descendant selector](selector.html#descendant-selectors) may\nnot achieve the results they expect. Consider the following rules:\n\n```\n\n<HTML>\n <HEAD>\n <TITLE>WARNING: Unexpected results due to cascade</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n ol.alpha li { list-style: lower-alpha }\n ul li { list-style: disc }\n </STYLE>\n </HEAD>\n <BODY>\n <OL class=\"alpha\">\n <LI>level 1\n <UL>\n <LI>level 2\n </UL>\n </OL>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n```\n\nThe desired rendering would have level 1 list items with\n'lower-alpha' labels and level 2 items with 'disc' labels. However,\nthe [cascading order](./cascade.html#cascading-order) will\ncause the first style rule (which includes specific class information)\nto mask the second. The following rules solve the problem by employing\na [child\nselector](./selector.html#child-selectors) instead:\n\n```\n\nol.alpha > li { list-style: lower-alpha }\nul li { list-style: disc }\n\n```\n\nAnother solution would be to specify ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) information only on\nthe list type elements:\n\n```\n\nol.alpha { list-style: lower-alpha }\nul { list-style: disc }\n\n```\n\nInheritance will transfer the ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) values from OL and\nUL elements to LI elements. This is the recommended way to\nspecify list style information.\n\nExample(s):\n\nA URI value may be combined with any other value, as in:\n\n```\n\nul { list-style: url(\"http://png.com/ellipse.png\") disc }\n\n```\n\n In the example above, the 'disc' will be used when the image is\nunavailable.\n\nA value of 'none' within the ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) property sets\nwhichever of ['list-style-type'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-type) and ['list-style-image'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-image) are not\notherwise specified to 'none'. However, if both are otherwise\nspecified, the declaration is in error (and thus ignored).\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, a value of 'none' for the ['list-style'](generate.html#propdef-list-style) property sets both\n['list-style-type'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-type) and\n['list-style-image'](generate.html#propdef-list-style-image) to\n'none':\n\n```\n\nul { list-style: none }\n\n```\n\nThe result is that no list-item marker is displayed.\n\n[previous](visufx.html) \n[next](page.html) \n[contents](Overview.html#minitoc) \n[properties](propidx.html) \n[index](indexlist.html)",
