[[TYPOGRAPHY]](#biblio-typography)\n\n 1.1. Module Interactions[](#placement)\n \nThis module, together with the [CSS Text Decoration Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/),\n replaces and extends the text-level features defined in [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 chapter 16](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html). [[CSS-TEXT-DECOR-3]](#biblio-css-text-decor-3) [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n\n \nIn addition to the terms defined below,\n other terminology and concepts used in this specification are defined\n in [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) and the [CSS Writing Modes Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/). [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) and [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4).\n\n 1.2. Value Definitions[](#values)\n \nThis specification follows the [CSS property definition conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) using the [value definition syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs) from [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [CSS-VALUES-3].\n Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.\n\n \nIn addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,\n all properties defined in this specification\n also accept the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) as their property value.\n For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.\n\n 1.3. Languages and Typesetting[](#languages)\n \n Authors should accurately language-tag their content\n for the best typographic behavior. \n\n \nMany typographic effects vary by linguistic context.\n Language and writing system conventions can affect\n line breaking, hyphenation, justification, glyph selection,\n and many other typographic effects. In CSS, language-specific typographic tailorings\n are only applied when the [content language](#content-language) is known (declared). Therefore,\n higher quality typography requires authors to communicate to the UA\n the correct linguistic context of the text in the document.\n\n \nThe **content language** of an element is the (human) language\n the element is declared to be in, according to the rules of the [document language](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage).\n Note that it is possible for the [content language](#content-language) of an element\n to be unknown—​e.g. untagged content,\n or content in a document language that does not have a language-tagging facility,\n is considered to have an unknown content language.\n\n \nNote: Authors can declare the [content language](#content-language) using the global `lang` attribute in HTML\n or the universal `xml:lang` attribute in XML.\n See the [rules for determining the content language of an HTML element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#language) in HTML,\n and the [rules for determining the content language of an XML element](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-lang-tag) in XML 1.0. [[HTML]](#biblio-html) [[XML10]](#biblio-xml10)\n\n \nThe [content language](#content-language) an element is declared to be in\n also identifies the specific written form of that language used in that element,\n known as the **content writing system**.\n Depending on the [document language](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage)’s facilities for identifying the content language,\n this information can be explicit or implied.\n See the normative [Appendix F:\nIdentifying the Content Writing System](#script-tagging).\n\n \nNote: Some languages have more than one writing system tradition;\n in other cases a language can be transliterated into a foreign writing system.\n Authors should [subtag](#script-tagging) such cases\n so that the UA can adapt appropriately.\n\n \n [](#example-bcb0a1b4) For example, Korean (`ko`) can be written in\n Hangul (`-Hang`),\n Hanja (`-Hani`),\n or a combination (`-Kore`).\n Historical documents written solely in Hanja\n do not use word spaces and\n are formatted more like modern Chinese than modern Korean.\n In other words, for typographic purposes `ko-Hani` behaves more like `zh-Hant` than `ko` (`ko-Kore`). \n \nAs another example Japanese (`ja`) is typically written\n in a combination (`-Japn`) of Hiragana (`-Hira`),\n Katakana (`-Kana`), and Kanji (`-Hani`).\n However, it can also be “romanized” into Latin (`-Latn`)\n for special purposes like language-learning textbooks,\n in which case it should be formatted more like English than Japanese.\n\n \nAs a third example contemporary Mongolian is written in two scripts:\n Cyrillic (`-Cyrl`, officially used in Mongolia)\n and Mongolian (`-Mong`, more common in Inner Mongolia, part of China).\n These have very different formatting requirements,\n with Cyrillic behaving similar to Latin and Greek,\n and Mongolian deriving from both Arabic and Chinese writing conventions.\n\n \n 1.4. Characters and Letters[](#characters)\n \n\n \nThe basic unit of typesetting is the **character**.\n However, because writing systems are not always as simple as the basic English alphabet,\n what a [character](#character) actually is depends on the context in which the term is used.\n For example, in Hangul (the Korean writing system),\n each square representation of a syllable\n (e.g. 한=Han)\n can be considered a character.\n However, the square symbol is really composed of multiple letters each representing a phoneme\n (e.g. ㅎ=h, ㅏ=a, ㄴ=n)\n and these also could each be considered a character.\n\n \nA basic unit of computer text encoding, for any given encoding,\n is also called a [character](#character),\n and depending on the encoding,\n a single encoding character might correspond\n to the entire pre-composed syllabic character (e.g. 한),\n to the individual phonemic character (e.g. ㅎ),\n or to smaller units such as\n a base letterform (e.g. ㅇ)\n and any combining marks that vary it (e.g. extra strokes that represent aspiration).\n\n \nIn turn, a single encoding [character](#character) can be represented in the data stream as one or more bytes;\n and in programming environments one byte is sometimes also called a character.\n\n \nTherefore the term [character](#character) is fairly ambiguous where technical precision is required.\n\n \nFor text layout, we will refer to the **typographic character unit** as the basic unit of text.\n Even within the realm of text layout,\n the relevant [character](#character) unit depends on the operation.\n For example, line-breaking and letter-spacing will segment\n a sequence of Thai characters that include U+0E33  ำ THAI CHARACTER SARA AM differently;\n or the behavior of a conjunct consonant in a script such as Devanagari\n may depend on the font in use.\n So the [typographic character](#typographic-character-unit) represents a unit of the writing system—​such as a Latin alphabetic letter (including its diacritics),\n Hangul syllable,\n Chinese ideographic character,\n Myanmar syllable cluster—​that is indivisible with respect to a particular typographic operation\n (line-breaking, first-letter effects, tracking, justification, vertical arrangement, etc.).\n\n \n[Unicode Standard Annex #29: Text Segmentation](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/) defines a unit called the **grapheme cluster** which approximates the [typographic character](#typographic-character-unit). [[UAX29]](#biblio-uax29) A UA must use the extended grapheme cluster (not legacy grapheme cluster), as defined in UAX29,\n as the basis for its typographic character unit.\n However, the UA should tailor the definitions\n as required by typographic tradition\n since the default rules are not always appropriate or ideal—​and is expected to tailor them differently\n depending on the operation as needed.\n\n \nNote: The rules for such tailorings are out of scope for CSS.\n\n \n [](#example-8c80c59b) The following are some examples of [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) tailorings\n required by standard typesetting practice: \n \n\n In some scripts such as Myanmar or Devanagari,\n the [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) for both justification and line-breaking\n is an entire syllable,\n which can include more than one Unicode [grapheme cluster](#grapheme-cluster). [[UAX29]](#biblio-uax29) \n \n In other scripts such as Thai or Lao,\n even though for line-breaking the [typographic character](#typographic-character-unit) matches Unicode’s default [grapheme clusters](#grapheme-cluster),\n for letter-spacing the relevant unit\n is less than a Unicode grapheme cluster,\n and may require decomposition or other substitutions\n before spacing can be inserted. [[UAX29]](#biblio-uax29) \n \nFor instance,\n to properly letter-space the Thai word คำ (U+0E04 + U+0E33),\n the U+0E33 needs to be decomposed into U+0E4D + U+0E32,\n and then the extra letter-space inserted before the U+0E32: คํ า.\n\n \nA slightly more complex example is น้ำ (U+0E19 + U+0E49 + U+0E33).\n In this case, normal Thai shaping will first decompose the U+0E33 into U+0E4D + U+0E32\n and then swap the U+0E4D with the U+0E49, giving U+0E19 + U+0E4D + U+0E49 + U+0E32.\n As before the extra letter-space is then inserted before the U+0E32: นํ้ า.\n\n Vertical typesetting can also require tailoring.\n For example, when typesetting [upright](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-text-orientation-upright) text,\n Tibetan tsek and shad marks are kept with the preceding grapheme cluster,\n rather than treated as an independent [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit). [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4) \n \n\n \n \nA **typographic letter unit** (or **letter** for the purpose of this specification)\n is a [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) belonging to one of the Letter or Number [general categories](#unicode-general-category).\n See [Appendix E:\nCharacters and Properties](#character-properties) for how to determine the Unicode properties of a typographic character unit.\n\n \nThe rendering characteristics of a [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) divided\n by an element boundary is undefined.\n Ideally each component should be rendered\n according to the formatting requirements of its respective element’s properties\n while maintaining correct shaping and positioning\n of the typographic character unit as a whole.\n However, depending on the nature of the formatting differences between its parts\n and the capabilities of the font technology in use,\n this is not always possible.\n Therefore such a typographic character unit may be rendered as belonging to either side of the boundary,\n or as some approximation of belonging to both.\n Authors are forewarned that dividing [grapheme clusters](#grapheme-cluster) or ligatures\n by element boundaries may give inconsistent or undesired results.\n\n 1.5. Text Processing[](#text-encoding)\n \nCSS is built on [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/). [[UNICODE]](#biblio-unicode) UAs that support Unicode must adhere to all normative requirements\n of the Unicode Core Standard,\n except where explicitly overridden by CSS.\n UAs implemented on the basis of a non-Unicode text encoding model are still\n expected to fulfill the same text handling requirements\n by assuming an appropriate mapping and analogous behavior.\n\n \nFor the purpose of determining adjacency for text processing\n (such as white space processing, text transformation, line-breaking, etc.),\n and thus in general within this specification,\n intervening [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box) boundaries and [out-of-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#out-of-flow) elements\n must be ignored.\n With respect to text shaping, however, see [§ 7.3 Shaping Across Element Boundaries](#boundary-shaping).",

Mapping Rules[](#text-transform-mapping)\n \nFor [capitalize](#valdef-text-transform-capitalize), what constitutes a “word“ is UA-dependent; [[UAX29]](#biblio-uax29) is suggested (but not required)\n for determining such word boundaries.\n Out-of-flow elements and inline element boundaries\n must not introduce a [text-transform](#propdef-text-transform) word boundary\n and must be ignored when determining such word boundaries.\n\n \nNote: Authors cannot depend on [capitalize](#valdef-text-transform-capitalize) to follow\n language-specific titlecasing conventions\n (such as skipping articles in English).\n\n \nThe UA must use the full case mappings for Unicode characters,\n including any conditional casing rules,\n as defined in the Default Case Algorithms section of The Unicode Standard. [[UNICODE]](#biblio-unicode) If (and only if) the [content language](#content-language) of the element is,\n according to the rules of the [document language](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage),\n known,\n then any appropriate language-specific rules must be applied as well.\n These minimally include,\n but are not limited to,\n the language-specific rules in Unicode’s [SpecialCasing.txt](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt).\n\n [](#example-f454e7b9) For example, in Turkish there are two “i”s,\n one with a dot—​“İ” and “i”—​and one without—​“I” and “ı”.\n Thus the usual case mappings between “I” and “i”\n are replaced with a different set of mappings\n to their respective dotless/dotted counterparts,\n which do not exist in English.\n This mapping must only take effect\n if the [content language](#content-language) is Turkish\n written in its modern Latin-based [writing system](#content-writing-system) (or another Turkic language that uses Turkish casing rules);\n in other languages,\n the usual mapping of “I” and “i” is required.\n This rule is thus conditionally defined in Unicode’s SpecialCasing.txt file. \n \nThe definition of **full-width** and **half-width** forms\n can be found in [Unicode Standard Annex #11: East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/). [[UAX11]](#biblio-uax11) The mapping to [full-width](#full-width) form is defined\n by taking code points with the `<wide>` or the `<narrow>` tag\n in their `Decomposition_Mapping` in [Unicode Standard Annex #44: Unicode Character Database](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/). [[UAX44]](#biblio-uax44) For the `<narrow>` tag,\n the mapping is from the code point to the decomposition\n (minus `<narrow>` tag),\n and for the `<wide>` tag,\n the mapping is from the decomposition\n (minus the `<wide>` tag)\n back to the original code point.\n\n \nThe mappings for [small Kana](#kana-small) to [full-size Kana](#kana-full-size) are defined in [Appendix G:\nSmall Kana Mappings](#small-kana).\n\n 2.1.2. Order of Operations[](#text-transform-order)\n \nWhen multiple values are specified\n and therefore multiple transformations need to be applied,\n they are applied in the following order:\n\n \n\n [capitalize](#valdef-text-transform-capitalize), [uppercase](#valdef-text-transform-uppercase), and [lowercase](#valdef-text-transform-lowercase) \n [full-width](#valdef-text-transform-full-width) \n [full-size-kana](#valdef-text-transform-full-size-kana) \n \n\n \nText transformation happens after [§ 4.1.1 Phase I: Collapsing and Transformation](#white-space-phase-1) but before [§ 4.1.2 Phase II: Trimming and Positioning](#white-space-phase-2).\n This means that [full-width](#valdef-text-transform-full-width) only transforms\n spaces (U+0020) to U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE within [preserved](#preserved-white-space) [white space](#white-space).\n\n \nNote: As defined in [Appendix A:\nText Processing Order of Operations](#order),\n transforming text affects line-breaking and other formatting operations.",

[[HTML]](#biblio-html) [[DOM]](#biblio-dom)\n\n \nNote: In most common CSS implementations,\n HTML does not get styled directly.\n Instead, it is processed into a DOM tree,\n which is then styled.\n Unlike HTML,\n the DOM does not give any particular meaning to carriage returns (U+000D),\n so they are not treated as [segment breaks](#segment-break).\n If carriage returns (U+000D) are inserted into the DOM\n by means other than HTML parsing,\n they then get treated as defined below.\n\n \nNote: A document parser might\n not only normalize any [segment breaks](#segment-break),\n but also collapse other space characters or\n otherwise process white space according to markup rules.\n Because CSS processing occurs after the parsing stage,\n it is not possible to restore these characters for styling.\n Therefore, some of the behavior specified below\n can be affected by these limitations and\n may be user agent dependent.\n\n \nNote: Anonymous blocks consisting entirely of [collapsible](#collapsible-white-space) [white space](#white-space) are removed from the rendering tree.\n Thus any such white space surrounding a block-level element is collapsed away.\n See [CSS 2.1 § 9.2.2.1 Anonymous inline boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous). [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n\n \nControl characters ([Unicode category](#unicode-general-category) `Cc`)—​other than tabs (U+0009),\n line feeds (U+000A),\n carriage returns (U+000D)\n and sequences that form a [segment break](#segment-break)—​must be rendered as a visible glyph\n which the UA must synthesize if the glyphs found in the font are not visible,\n and must be otherwise treated as any other character\n of the Other Symbols (`So`) general category and Common [script](#unicode-script).\n The UA may use a glyph provided by a font specifically for the control character,\n substitute the glyphs provided for the corresponding symbol in the Control Pictures block,\n generate a visual representation of its code point value,\n or use some other method to provide an appropriate visible glyph.\n As required by Unicode,\n unsupported `Default_ignorable` characters\n must be ignored for text rendering. [[UNICODE]](#biblio-unicode)\n\n \nCarriage returns (U+000D) are treated identically to spaces (U+0020) in all respects.\n\n \nNote: For HTML documents,\n carriage returns present in the source code\n are converted to line feeds at the parsing stage\n (see [HTML § 13.2.3.5 Preprocessing the input stream](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream) and the definition of [normalize newlines](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#normalize-newlines) in [Infra](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/) and therefore do no appear as U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN to CSS.

The White Space Processing Rules[](#white-space-rules)\n \nExcept where specified otherwise,\n white space processing in CSS affects only\n the **document white space characters**: **spaces** (U+0020), **tabs** (U+0009), and [segment breaks](#white-space-processing).\n\n \nNote: The set of characters considered [document white space](#white-space) (part of the document content)\n and those considered syntactic white space\n (part of the CSS syntax)\n are not necessarily identical.\n However, since both include spaces (U+0020), tabs (U+0009), and line feeds (U+000A)\n most authors won’t notice any differences.\n\n \nBesides space (U+0020)\n and no-break space (U+00A0),\n Unicode defines a number of additional space separator characters. [[UNICODE]](#biblio-unicode) In this specification\n all characters in the Unicode [general category](#unicode-general-category) Zs\n except space (U+0020)\n and no-break space (U+00A0)\n are collectively referred to as **other space separators**.\n\n 4.1.1.

[[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14) More information on line breaking conventions\n can be found in [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/) [[JLREQ]](#biblio-jlreq) and Formatting Rules for Japanese Documents [[JIS4051]](#biblio-jis4051) for Japanese, [Requirements for Chinese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/) [[CLREQ]](#biblio-clreq) and General Rules for Punctuation [[ZHMARK]](#biblio-zhmark) for Chinese.\n See also the [Internationalization Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/)’s [Language Enablement Index](https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/#blocks_paragraphs) which includes more information on additional languages.

Line Breaking Details[](#line-break-details)\n \n\n \nWhen determining [line breaks](#line-break):\n\n \n\n The interaction of [line breaking](#line-breaking-process) and bidirectional text is defined by [CSS Writing Modes 4 § 2.4 Applying the Bidirectional Reordering Algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#bidi-algo) and the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm ([UAX9§3.4 Reordering Resolved Levels](http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Reordering_Resolved_Levels) in particular). [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4) [[UAX9]](#biblio-uax9) \n \n Preserved segment breaks, and—​regardless of the [white-space](#propdef-white-space) value—​any Unicode character with the `BK` and `NL` line breaking class,\n must be treated as forced line breaks. [[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14) \n \nNote: The bidi implications of such [forced line breaks](#forced-line-break) are defined by the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/). [[UAX9]](#biblio-uax9)\n\n Except where explicitly defined otherwise\n (e.g. for [line-break: anywhere](#propdef-line-break) or [overflow-wrap: anywhere](#propdef-overflow-wrap))\n line breaking behavior defined for\n the `WJ`, `ZW`, `GL`,\n and `ZWJ` Unicode line breaking classes\n must be honored. [[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14) \n UAs that allow wrapping at punctuation\n other than [word separators](#word-separator) in writing systems that use them should prioritize breakpoints.\n (For example, if breaks after slashes are given a lower priority than spaces,\n the sequence “check /etc” will never break between the \"/\" and the \"e\".)\n As long as care is taken to avoid such awkward breaks,\n allowing breaks at appropriate punctuation other than word separators is recommended,\n as it results in more even-looking margins, particularly in narrow measures.\n The UA may use the width of the containing block, the text’s language,\n the [line-break](#propdef-line-break) value,\n and other factors in assigning priorities:\n CSS does not define prioritization of [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity).\n Prioritization of word separators is not expected,\n however,\n if [word-break: break-all](#propdef-word-break) is specified\n (since this value explicitly requests line breaking behavior\n not based on breaking at word separators)—​and is forbidden under line-break: anywhere. \n Out-of-flow elements\n and inline element boundaries\n do not introduce a [forced line break](#forced-line-break) or [soft wrap opportunity](#soft-wrap-opportunity) in the flow. \n For Web-compatibility\n there is a [soft wrap opportunity](#soft-wrap-opportunity) before and after each replaced element or other [atomic inline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#atomic-inline),\n even when adjacent to a character that would normally suppress them,\n including U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE.\n However,\n with the exception of U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE,\n there must be no soft wrap opportunity between atomic inlines and adjacent characters\n belonging to the Unicode GL, WJ, or ZWJ line breaking classes. [[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14) \n For [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity) created by characters\n that disappear at the line break (e.g. U+0020 SPACE),\n properties on the box directly containing that character\n control the line breaking at that opportunity.\n For soft wrap opportunities defined by the boundary between two characters or [atomic inlines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#atomic-inline),\n the [white-space](#propdef-white-space) property\n on the nearest common ancestor of the two characters\n controls breaking;\n which elements’ [line-break](#propdef-line-break), [word-break](#propdef-word-break), and [overflow-wrap](#propdef-overflow-wrap) properties\n control the determination of soft wrap opportunities at such boundaries\n is undefined in Level 3. \n For [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity) before the first\n or after the last character of a box,\n the break occurs immediately before/after the box\n (at its margin edge)\n rather than breaking the box\n between its content edge and the content. \n Line breaking in/around Ruby is defined\n in [CSS Ruby Annotation Layout 1 § 3.4 Breaking Across Lines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#line-breaks). [[CSS-RUBY-1]](#biblio-css-ruby-1) \n \n In order to avoid unexpected overflow,\n if the user agent is unable to perform the requisite lexical\n or orthographic analysis\n for line breaking any [content language](#content-language) that requires it—​for example due to lacking a dictionary for certain languages—​it must assume a [soft wrap opportunity](#soft-wrap-opportunity) between pairs of [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) in that writing system. \n \nNote: This provision is not triggered merely when\n the UA fails to find a word boundary in a particular text run;\n the text run may well be a single unbreakable word.\n It applies for example\n when a text run is composed of Khmer characters (U+1780 to U+17FF)\n if the user agent does not know how to determine\n word boundaries in Khmer.\n\n \n\n 5.2.

[[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14) It does not affect rules governing the soft wrap opportunities created by [white space](#white-space) (as well as by [other space separators](#other-space-separators))\n and around punctuation.\n (See [line-break](#propdef-line-break) for controls affecting punctuation and small kana.)\n\n \n [](#example-f0d22488) For example,\n in some styles of CJK typesetting,\n English words are allowed to break between any two letters,\n rather than only at spaces or hyphenation points;\n this can be enabled with word-break:break-all. \n \n \n An example of English text embedded in Japanese\n being broken at an arbitrary point in the word. \n \n \nAs another example, Korean has two styles of line-breaking:\n between any two Korean syllables ([word-break: normal](#propdef-word-break))\n or, like English, mainly at spaces (word-break: keep-all).\n\n```\n각 줄의 마지막에 한글이 올 때 줄 나눔 기\n준을 “글자” 또는 “어절” 단위로 한다.\n\n```\n\n```\n각 줄의 마지막에 한글이 올 때 줄 나눔\n기준을 “글자” 또는 “어절” 단위로 한다.\n\n```\n\n \nEthiopic similarly has two styles of line-breaking,\n either only breaking at [word separators](#word-separator) ([word-break: normal](#propdef-word-break)),\n or also allowing breaks between letters within a word (word-break: break-all).\n\n```\nተወልዱ፡ኵሉ፡ሰብእ፡ግዑዛን፡ወዕሩያን፡\nበማዕረግ፡ወብሕግ።ቦሙ፡ኅሊና፡ወዐቅል፡\nወይትጌበሩ፡አሐዱ፡ምስለ፡አሀዱ፡\nበመንፈሰ፡እኍና።\n\n```\n\n```\nተወልዱ፡ኵሉ፡ሰብእ፡ግዑዛን፡ወዕሩያን፡በማ\nዕረግ፡ወብሕግ።ቦሙ፡ኅሊና፡ወዐቅል፡ወይትጌ\nበሩ፡አሐዱ፡ምስለ፡አሀዱ፡በመንፈሰ፡እኍና።\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: To enable additional break opportunities only in the case of overflow,\n see [overflow-wrap](#propdef-overflow-wrap).\n\n \nValues have the following meanings:\n\n \n **normal** \n Words break according to their customary rules,\n as described [above](#line-breaking).\n Korean, which commonly exhibits two different behaviors,\n allows breaks between any two consecutive Hangul/Hanja.\n For Ethiopic, which also exhibits two different behaviors,\n such breaks within words are not allowed. \n **break-all** \n \n Breaking is allowed within “words”:\n specifically,\n in addition to [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity) allowed for [normal](#valdef-word-break-normal),\n any [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) (and any [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit) resolving to the `NU` (“numeric”), `AL` (“alphabetic”),\n or `SA` (“Southeast Asian”)\n line breaking classes [[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14))\n are instead treated as `ID` (“ideographic characters”)\n for the purpose of line-breaking.\n Hyphenation is not applied. \n \nNote: This value does not affect\n whether there are [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity) around punctuation characters.\n To allow breaks anywhere, see [line-break: anywhere](#propdef-line-break).\n\n \nNote: This option enables the other common behavior for Ethiopic.\n It is also often used in a context where\n the text consists predominantly of CJK characters\n with only short non-CJK excerpts,\n and it is desired that the text be better distributed on each line.\n\n **keep-all** \n \n Breaking is forbidden within “words”:\n implicit [soft wrap opportunities](#soft-wrap-opportunity) between [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) (or other [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit) belonging to the `NU`, `AL`, `AI`,\n or `ID` Unicode line breaking classes [[UAX14]](#biblio-uax14))\n are suppressed,\n i.e. breaks are prohibited between pairs of such characters\n (regardless of [line-break](#propdef-line-break) settings other than [anywhere](#valdef-line-break-anywhere))\n except where opportunities exist due to dictionary-based breaking.\n Otherwise this option is equivalent to [normal](#valdef-word-break-normal).\n In this style, sequences of CJK characters do not break. \n \nNote: This is the other common behavior for Korean\n (which uses [spaces](#spaces) between words),\n and is also useful for mixed-script text where CJK snippets are mixed\n into another language that uses spaces for separation.\n\n \n \nSymbols that line-break the same way as letters of a particular category\n are affected the same way as those letters.\n\n \n [](#example-cc487741) Here’s a mixed-script sample text: \n\n```\n这是一些汉字 and some Latin و کمی خط عربی และตัวอย่างการเขียนภาษาไทย በጽሑፍ፡ማራዘሙን፡አንዳንድ፡\n\n```\n\n \nThe break-points

words.\n However, it is sometimes preferred to suppress these wrapping opportunities\n and to only allow wrapping at the end of certain sentence fragments.\n This is most commonly done in very short pieces of text,\n such as headings and table or figure captions.\n\n \nThis can be achieved by marking the allowed wrapping points\n with `[wbr](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-wbr-element)` or U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE,\n and suppressing the other ones using [word-break: keep-all](#propdef-word-break).\n\n \nFor instance, the following markup can produce either of the renderings below,\n depending on the value of the [word-break](#propdef-word-break) property:\n\n```\n<h1>窓ぎわの<wbr>トットちゃん</h1>\n\n```\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n h1 { word-break: normal } \n h1 { word-break: keep-all } \n \n \n Expected rendering \n \n\n```\n窓ぎわのトットちゃ\nん\n\n```\n\n \n\n```\n窓ぎわの\nトットちゃん\n\n```\n\n \n Result in your browser \n 窓ぎわのトットちゃん \n 窓ぎわのトットちゃん \n \n \n \nWhen shaping scripts such as Arabic\n are allowed to break within words due to [break-all](#valdef-word-break-break-all) the characters must still be shaped\n as if the word were [not broken](#word-break-shaping) (see [§ 5.6 Shaping Across Intra-word Breaks](#word-break-shaping)).\n\n \nFor compatibility with legacy content,\n the [word-break](#propdef-word-break) property also supports\n a deprecated **break-word** keyword.\n When specified, this has the same effect as word-break: normal and [overflow-wrap: anywhere](#propdef-overflow-wrap),\n regardless of the actual value of the overflow-wrap property.\n\n 5.3.

Typically used for short lines, such as in newspapers. \n **normal** \n Breaks text using the most common set of line-breaking rules. \n **strict** \n Breaks text using the most stringent set of line-breaking rules. \n **anywhere** \n \n There is a [soft wrap opportunity](#soft-wrap-opportunity) around every [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit),\n including around any punctuation character\n or [preserved white spaces](#preserved-white-space),\n or in the middle of words,\n disregarding any prohibition against line breaks,\n even those introduced by characters with the `GL`, `WJ`, or `ZWJ` line breaking classes\n or mandated by the [word-break](#propdef-word-break) property.

block containers\n to the root inline box containing their inline-level contents.\n It takes the following values:\n\n \n **auto** \n \n The UA determines the justification algorithm to follow,\n based on a balance between performance and adequate presentation quality.\n Since justification rules vary by [writing system](#content-writing-system) and [language](#content-language),\n UAs should, where possible,\n use a justification algorithm appropriate to the text. \n [](#example-0bd57ccb) For example,\n the UA could use by default a justification method\n that is a simple universal compromise for all writing systems—​such as primarily expanding [word separators](#word-separator) and between CJK [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) along with secondarily expanding\n between Southeast Asian typographic letter units.\n Then, in cases where the [content language](#content-language) of the paragraph is known,\n it could choose a more language-tailored justification behavior\n e.g. following the [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/) for Japanese [[JLREQ]](#biblio-jlreq),\n using cursive elongation for Arabic,\n using [inter-word](#valdef-text-justify-inter-word) for German,\n etc. \n \n \n\n An example of cursively-justified Arabic text,\n rendered by [Tasmeem](https://www.decotype.com/).\n Like English,\n Arabic can be justified by adjusting the spacing between words,\n but in most styles\n it can also be justified by calligraphically elongating\n or compressing the letterforms themselves.\n In this example,\n the upper text is extended to fill the line\n by the use of elongated (kashida) forms and swash forms,\n while the bottom line is compressed slightly\n by using a stacked combination for the characters between ت and م.\n By employing traditional calligraphic techniques,\n a typesetter can justify the line while preserving flow and color,\n providing a very high quality justification effect.\n However, this is by its nature a very script-specific effect. \n \n \n \n Mixed-script text with [text-justify: auto](#propdef-text-justify):\n this interpretation uses a universal-compromise justification method,\n expanding at spaces as well as between CJK and Southeast Asian letters.\n This effectively uses inter-word + inter-ideograph spacing\n for lines that have word-separators and/or CJK characters\n and falls back to inter-cluster behavior for lines that don’t\n or for which the space stretches too far. \n \n **none** \n \n Justification is disabled:\n there are no [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) within the text. \n \n \n Mixed-script text with [text-justify: none](#propdef-text-justify) \n \n \nNote: This value is intended for use in user stylesheets\n to improve readability or for accessibility purposes.\n\n **inter-word** \n \n Justification adjusts spacing at [word separators](#word-separator) only\n (effectively varying the used [word-spacing](#propdef-word-spacing) on the line).\n This behavior is typical for languages that separate words using spaces,\n like English or Korean. \n \n \n Mixed-script text with [text-justify: inter-word](#propdef-text-justify) \n \n **inter-character** \n \n Justification adjusts spacing\n between each pair of adjacent [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit) (effectively varying the used [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) on the line).\n This value is sometimes used in East Asian systems such as Japanese. \n \n \n Mixed-script text with [text-justify: inter-character](#propdef-text-justify) \n \n \nFor legacy reasons,\n UAs must also support the alternate keyword **distribute** which must compute to [inter-character](#valdef-text-justify-inter-character),\n thus having the exact same meaning and behavior.\n UAs may treat this as a [legacy value alias](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#css-legacy-value-alias).\n\n \n \n Since optimal justification is [language](#content-language)-sensitive,\n authors should correctly language-tag their content for the best results. \n\n \nNote: The guidelines in this level of CSS\n do not describe a complete justification algorithm.\n They are merely a minimum set of requirements\n that a complete algorithm should meet.\n Limiting the set of requirements gives UAs some latitude\n in choosing a justification algorithm\n that meets their needs and desired balance of quality, speed, and complexity.\n\n 6.4.1. Expanding and Compressing Text[](#expanding-text)\n \n\n \nWhen justifying text,\n the user agent takes the remaining space\n between the ends of a line’s contents and the edges of its line box,\n and distributes that space throughout its content\n so that the contents exactly fill the line box.\n The user agent may alternatively distribute negative space,\n putting more content on the line\n than would otherwise fit under normal spacing conditions.\n\n \nA justification opportunity is a point\n where the justification algorithm may alter spacing within the text.\n A justification opportunity can be provided by a single [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) (such as a [word separator](#word-separator)),\n or by the juxtaposition of two typographic character units.\n As with controls for [soft wrap opportunities](#line-break-details),\n whether a typographic character unit provides a [justification opportunity](#justification-opportunity) is controlled by the [text-justify](#propdef-text-justify) value of its parent;\n similarly,\n whether a justification opportunity exists\n between two consecutive typographic character units is determined by the text-justify value of their nearest common ancestor.\n\n \nSpace distributed by justification is in addition to the spacing defined by the [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) or [word-spacing](#propdef-word-spacing) properties.\n When such additional space is distributed\n to a [word separator](#word-separator) [justification opportunity](#justification-opportunity),\n it is applied under the same rules as for word-spacing.\n Similarly, when space is distributed\n to a justification opportunity between two [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit),\n should be applied under the same rules as for letter-spacing.\n\n \nA justification algorithm may divide [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) into different priority levels.\n All justification opportunities within a given level\n are expanded or compressed at the same priority,\n regardless of which [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit) created that opportunity.\n For example,\n if justification opportunities between two Han characters\n and between two Latin letters\n are defined to be at the same level\n (as they are in the [inter-character](#valdef-text-justify-inter-character) justification style),\n they are not treated differently\n because they originate from different typographic character units.\n It is not defined in this level\n whether or how other factors\n (such as font size, letter-spacing, glyph shape, position within the line, etc.)\n may influence the distribution of space to justification opportunities within the line.\n\n \nThe UA may enable or break optional ligatures\n or use other font features\n such as alternate glyphs or glyph compression\n to help justify the text under any method.\n This behavior is not controlled by this level of CSS.\n However,\n UAs must not break required ligatures\n or otherwise disable features required to correctly shape complex scripts.\n\n \nIf a [justification opportunity](#justification-opportunity) exists within a line,\n and [text alignment](#text-align-property) specifies full justification\n ([justify](#valdef-text-align-justify))\n for that line,\n it must be justified.\n\n 6.4.2. Handling Symbols and Punctuation[](#justify-symbols)\n \nWhen determining [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity),\n a [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) from the Unicode Symbols (S*) and Punctuation (P*) classes\n is generally treated the same as a [typographic letter unit](#typographic-letter-unit) of the same script\n (or, if the character’s script property is Common,\n then as a typographic letter unit of the dominant script).\n\n \nHowever, by typographic tradition\n there may be additional rules controlling the justification of symbols and punctuation.\n Therefore, the UA may reassign specific characters\n or introduce additional levels of prioritization\n to handle [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) involving symbols and punctuation.\n\n [](#example-3ce55d62) For example, there are traditionally no [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) between consecutive\n U+2014 — EM DASH,\n U+2015 ― HORIZONTAL BAR,\n U+2026 … HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS,\n or U+2025 ‥ TWO DOT LEADER\n characters [[JLREQ]](#biblio-jlreq);\n thus a UA might assign these characters to a “never” prioritization level.\n As another example, certain full-width punctuation characters\n (such as U+301A 〚 LEFT WHITE SQUARE BRACKET)\n are considered to contain a justification opportunity in Japanese.\n The UA might therefore assign these characters to a higher prioritization\n level than the opportunities between ideographic characters. \n 6.4.3. Unexpandable Text[](#justify-limits)\n \n\n \nIf the inline contents of a line cannot be stretched to the full width of the line box,\n then they must be aligned as specified by the [text-align-last](#propdef-text-align-last) property.\n (If text-align-last is [justify](#valdef-text-align-justify),\n then they must be aligned as for [center](#valdef-text-align-center).)\n\n 6.4.4. Cursive Scripts[](#justify-cursive)\n \nJustification must not introduce gaps\n between the joined [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) of [cursive scripts](#cursive-script) such as Arabic.\n If it is able,\n the UA may translate space distributed to [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) within a run of such typographic letter units into some form of cursive elongation for that run.\n It otherwise must assume that no justification opportunity exists\n between any pair of typographic letter units in cursive script (regardless of whether they join).\n\n \n [](#example-5407996d) The following are examples of unacceptable justification: \n \n \n Adding gaps between every pair of Arabic letters \n \n \n \n Adding gaps between every pair of unjoined Arabic letters \n \n \n \nSome font designs allow for the use of the tatweel character for justification.\n A UA that performs tatweel-based justification\n must properly handle the rules for its use.\n Note that correct insertion of tatweel characters depends on context,\n including the letter-combinations involved,\n location within the word,\n and location of the word within the line.\n\n 6.4.5. Minimum Requirements for [auto](#valdef-text-justify-auto) Justification[](#justify-algos)\n \nFor [auto](#valdef-text-justify-auto) justification,\n this specification does not define\n what all of the [justification opportunities](#justification-opportunity) are,\n how they are prioritized,\n or when and how multiple levels of justification opportunities interact.\n However, it does require that:\n\n \n\n \n Unless contraindicated by the typographic traditions\n of the [content language](#content-language) or adjacent symbols/punctuation,\n each of the following provides a [justification opportunity](#justification-opportunity): \n \n\n [Word separators](#word-separator) \n The boundary between a [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) of any [block scripts](#block-scripts) and any other typographic character unit \n The boundary between a [typographic character unit](#typographic-character-unit) of any [clustered scripts](#clustered-scripts) and any other typographic character unit \n \n\n All [letters](#letter) belonging to all [block scripts](#block-scripts) are treated the same,\n and all letters belonging to all [clustered scripts](#clustered-scripts) are treated the same.\n For example, no distinction is made\n between the justification opportunity\n between a Han letter followed by another Han letter,\n vs. the justification opportunity\n between a Han letter followed by a Hangul letter. \n \n\n \nFurther information on text justification can be found in (or submitted to) [“Approaches to Full Justification”](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/justification),\n which indexes by writing system and language,\n and is maintained by the [W3C Internationalization Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/).

}\n```\n\n```\n<p>a<span>bb</span>c</p>\n```\n\n \na　b　b　c\n\n \na　b　b　c\n\n \nConsequently a given value of [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) is expected\n to only affect the spacing between characters\n completely contained within the element for which it is specified:\n\n```\np { letter-spacing: 1em; }\nspan { letter-spacing: 2em; }\n\n```\n\n```\n<p>a<span>bb</span>c</p>\n```\n\n \na　b　　b　c\n\n \nThis further implies that applying [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) to\n an element containing only a single character\n has no effect on the rendered result: \n\n```\np { letter-spacing: 1em; }\nspan { letter-spacing: 2em; }\n\n```\n\n```\n<p>a<span>b</span>c</p>\n```\n\n \na　b　c\n\n \nSince letter spacing is inserted after RTL reordering,\n the letter spacing applied to the inner span below likewise has no effect,\n since after reordering the \"c\" doesn’t end up next to \"א\":\n\n```\np { letter-spacing: 1em; }\nspan { letter-spacing: 2em; }\n\n```\n\n```\n<!-- abc followed by Hebrew letters alef (א), bet (ב) and gimel (ג) -->\n<!-- Reordering will display these in reverse order. -->\n<p>ab<span>cא</span>בג</p>\n\n```\n\n \na　b　c　א　ב　ג\n\n \n \nLetter spacing ignores invisible zero-width formatting characters\n (such as those from the Unicode Cf category).\n Spacing must be added as if those characters did not exist in the document.\n\n [](#example-35549407) For example, [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) applied to A&#x200B;B is identical to AB,\n regardless of where any element boundaries might fall. \n \nWhen the effective spacing between two characters is not zero\n (due to either [justification](#text-justify-property) or a non-zero value of [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing)),\n user agents should not apply optional ligatures,\n i.e. those that are not defined as required\n for fundamentally correct glyph shaping.\n However, ligatures and other font features\n specified via the low-level [font-feature-settings](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-feature-settings) property\n take precedence over this rule.\n See [CSS Fonts Module Level 3 § feature-precedence](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#feature-precedence).\n\n \n [](#example-d2a0b994) For example, if the word “filial” is letter-spaced,\n an “fi” ligature should not be used\n as it will prevent even spacing of the text. \n filial vs ﬁlial \n \n \nNote: In OpenType, required ligatures are expected\n to be associated to the `rlig` feature.\n All other ligatures are therefore considered optional.\n In some cases, however, UA or platform heuristics\n apply additional ligatures in order to handle broken fonts;\n this specification does not define or override such exceptional handling.\n\n 7.2.1. Cursive Scripts[](#cursive-tracking)\n \nIf it is able,\n the UA may apply letter spacing to [cursive scripts](#cursive-script) by translating the total extra space to be distributed to a run of such letters\n into some form of cursive elongation\n (or compression, for negative tracking values)\n for that run\n that results in an equivalent total expansion (or compression) of the run.\n Otherwise,\n if the UA cannot expand text from a cursive script without breaking its cursive connections,\n it must not apply spacing\n between any pair of that script’s [typographic letter units](#typographic-letter-unit) at all\n (effectively treating each word as a single typographic letter unit for the purpose of letter-spacing).\n Both cases will result in an effective spacing of zero between such letters;\n however the former will preserve the sense of stretching out the text.\n\n \n [](#example-9902d8b5) Below are some appropriate and inappropriate examples of spacing out Arabic text. \n \n \n \n \n — \n Original text \n \n \n \n BAD \n Even distribution of space between each letter. Notice this breaks cursive joins! \n \n \n OK \n Distributing ∑letter-spacing by typographically-appropriate cursive elongation. The resulting text is as long as the previous evenly-spaced example. \n \n \n OK \n Suppressing [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) between Arabic letters. Notice [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) is nonetheless applied\n to non-Arabic characters (like [spaces](#spaces)). \n \n \n BAD \n Applying [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) only between non-joined letters. This distorts typographic color and obfuscates word boundaries. \n \n \n \nNote: Proper cursive elongation or compression of a text\n can vary depending on the\n script,\n typeface,\n language,\n location within a word,\n location within a line,\n implementation complexity,\n font capabilities,\n and calligraphic preferences,\n and may not be possible in certain cases at all.\n It may involve the use of shortening ligatures,\n swash variants,\n contextual forms,\n elongation glyphs such as U+0640 ـ ARABIC TATWEEL,\n or other microtypography.\n It is outside the scope of CSS to define rules for these effects.\n Authors should avoid applying [letter-spacing](#propdef-letter-spacing) to cursive scripts\n unless they are prepared to accept non-interoperable results.\n\n 7.3. Shaping Across Element Boundaries[](#boundary-shaping)\n \nText shaping must be broken at inline box boundaries\n when any of the following are true\n for any box whose boundary separates the two [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit):\n\n \n\n Any of [margin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-margin)/[border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border)/[padding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-padding) separating the two [typographic character units](#typographic-character-unit) in the inline axis\n is non-zero. \n [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) is not [baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#valdef-alignment-baseline-baseline). \n The boundary is a [bidi isolation boundary](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#bidi-isolate). \n \n\n \nText shaping must not be broken across inline box boundaries\n when there is no effective change in formatting,\n or if the only formatting changes do not affect the glyphs\n (as in applying [text decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/)).\n\n \nText shaping should not be broken across inline box boundaries otherwise,\n if it is reasonable and possible for that case given the limitations of the font technology.\n\n \n [](#example-d57c8f22) An example of reasonable and possible shaping across boundaries\n is Arabic shaping:\n in many systems this is performed by the font engine,\n allowing the font to provide variant glyphs\n with potentially very sophisticated contextual shaping.\n It’s not generally possible to rely on this system across a font change\n unless the font engine has an API to provide context,\n but it is straightforward and therefore quite reasonable\n for an engine to work around this limitation by, for example,\n using the zero-width-joiner (U+200D) or zero-width-non-joiner (U+200C)\n as appropriate to solicit the correct choice of\n initial/medial/final/isolated glyph. \n \nAn example of possible but not reasonable shaping across boundaries\n is handling a font that is sensitive to 20 characters of context\n on either side to choose its glyphs:\n passing all the text before and after the string in question,\n even through multiple inline boundaries with formatting changes,\n is complicated.\n The UA could handle such cases,\n but is not required to,\n as they are not typical or fundamentally required\n by any modern writing system.\n\n \nAn example of impossible shaping across boundaries\n is a change in font weight partway through the word “and”\n in a font where a ligature would replace\n all three letters of the word “and”\n with an ampersand glyph (“&”).",

[[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4) For example, the first line of an anonymous block box is only affected\n if it is the first child of its parent element.\n\n \nValues have the following meanings:\n\n \n **<length>** \n Gives the amount of the indent as an absolute length. \n **<percentage>** \n \n Gives the amount of the indent\n as a percentage of the block container’s own [logical width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#logical-width). \n \nPercentages must be treated as 0 for the purpose of calculating [intrinsic size contributions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-size-contribution),\n but are always resolved normally when performing layout.\n\n \nNote: This can lead to the element overflowing.\n It is not recommended to use percentage indents and intrinsic sizing together.\n\n **each-line** \n Indentation affects the first line of each block container\n and each line after a [forced line break](#forced-line-break) (but not lines after a [soft wrap break](#soft-wrap-break)). \n **hanging** \n Inverts which lines are affected. \n \n \n [](#example-7dde3c71) \n \nIf [text-align](#propdef-text-align) is [start](#valdef-text-align-start) and [text-indent](#propdef-text-indent) is 5em in\n left-to-right text with no floats present, then first line of text\n will start 5em into the block:\n\n```\n Since CSS1 it has been possible to\nindent the first line of a block element\n5em by setting the 'text-indent' property \nto '5em'.\n\n```\n\n \nIf we add the [hanging](#valdef-text-indent-hanging) keyword,\n then the first line will start flush,\n but other lines will be indented 5em:\n\n```\nIn CSS3 we can instead indent all other\n lines of the block element by 5em\n by setting the 'text-indent' property\n to 'hanging 5em'.\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-f29e1f90) Since the [text-indent](#propdef-text-indent) property only affects the “first formatted line”,\n a line after a forced break will not be indented. \n\n```\n For example, in the middle of\nthis paragraph is an equation,\nwhich is centered:\n x + y = z\nThe first line after the equation\nis flush (else it would look like\nwe started a new paragraph).\n\n```\n\n \nHowever, sometimes (as in poetry or code),\n it is appropriate to indent each line\n that happens to be long enough to wrap.\n In the following example, [text-indent](#propdef-text-indent) is given a value of 3em hanging each-line,\n giving the third line of the poem a hanging indent\n where it soft-wraps at the block’s right boundary:\n\n```\nIn a short line of text\nThere need be no wrapping,\nBut when we go on and on and on  \n and on,\nSometimes a soft break\nCan help us stay on the page.\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: Since the [text-indent](#propdef-text-indent) property inherits,\n when specified on a block element, it will affect descendant\n inline-block elements.\n For this reason, it is often wise to specify text-indent: 0 on\n elements that are specified [display: inline-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display).\n\n \n\n 8.2. Hanging Glyphs[](#hanging)\n \nWhen a glyph at the start or end edge of a line **hangs**,\n it is not considered\n when measuring the line’s contents for fit, alignment, or justification.\n Depending on the line’s alignment/justification, this can\n result in the mark being placed outside the line box.\n The [hanging](#hang) glyph is also not taken into account\n when computing [intrinsic sizes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-size) ([min-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-content) and [max-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content)),\n and any sizes derived thereof.\n (The interaction of this measurement and kerning is currently UA-defined;\n the CSSWG [welcomes advice](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2397) on this point.)\n\n \nA **[hanging](#hang) glyph** is still enclosed inside its parent inline box\n and still participates in text justification:\n its character advance is just not measured when determining\n how much content fits on the line,\n how much the line’s contents need to be expanded or compressed for justification,\n or how to position the content within the line box for text alignment.\n Effectively, the [hanging](#hang) glyph character advance\n is re-interpreted as an additional negative margin\n on the affected edge of its parent [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box);\n the line is otherwise laid out as usual.\n An overflowing [hanging glyph](#hanging-glyph) should typically be considered [ink overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#ink-overflow) so as to avoid creating unnecessary scrollbars,\n but the UA may treat it as [scrollable overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow) when the content is editable\n or in other circumstances where treating it as scrollable overflow would be useful to the user. [[CSS-OVERFLOW-3]](#biblio-css-overflow-3)\n\n \nIn some cases, a glyph at the end of a line\n can **conditionally hang**:\n it [hangs](#hang) only if it does not otherwise fit in the line prior to justification.\n It is not considered when measuring the line’s contents for fit;\n however, any part of it that does not fit\n is considered to hang.\n Glyphs that [conditionally hang](#conditionally-hang) are not taken into account\n when computing [min-content sizes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-content) and any sizes derived thereof,\n but they are taken into account for [max-content sizes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content) and any sizes derived thereof.\n\n \nNon-zero inline-axis borders or padding between\n a [hang](#hang)able glyph and the edge of the line prevent the glyph from hanging.\n For example, a period at the end of an inline box with end padding\n does not hang at the end edge of a line.\n\n \nMultiple adjacent glyphs can hang together,\n however specific limits on how many are allowed to hang may be specified\n (e.g. at most one punctuation character may [hang](#hang) at each edge of the line).\n\n 8.2.1.

Bidirectionality and Line Boxes[](#bidi-linebox)\n \nThe [start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#start) and [end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#end) sides of a line box\n are determined by the [inline base direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-base-direction) of the line box.\n Although they usually match,\n the inline base direction of a [line box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#line-box) is distinct from the inline base direction of the [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#containing-block) or the [bidi paragraph](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#bidi-paragraph).\n The line box’s inline base direction affects [text-align-all](#propdef-text-align-all), [text-align-last](#propdef-text-align-last), [text-indent](#propdef-text-indent), and [hanging-punctuation](#propdef-hanging-punctuation)—​i.e. the position and alignment of its contents with respect to its edges.\n It does not affect the formatting or ordering of inline content\n (which is controlled by the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/) as applied by [CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/) [[UAX9]](#biblio-uax9) [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4)).\n\n \nIn most cases, a [line box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#line-box)’s [inline base direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-base-direction) is given by its [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#containing-block)’s computed [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction).\n However,\n if its containing block has [unicode-bidi: plaintext](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-unicode-bidi) [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4):\n\n \n\n If the [bidi paragraph](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#bidi-paragraph) to which the [line box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#line-box) belongs\n (that is, the bidi paragraph for which the line box holds content)\n has strong directionality,\n the line box’s [inline base direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-base-direction) is that direction. \n If the [line box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#line-box) is empty\n (i.e. contains no [atomic inlines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#atomic-inline) or\n characters other than the newline character, if any)\n or otherwise has no strong directionality\n (contains only weak or neutral characters),\n its [inline base direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-base-direction) is taken\n from the preceding line box (if any),\n or, if this is the first line box in the containing block,\n from the [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction) property of the containing block.\n (This can result in an RTL line box whose contents have an LTR base direction.) \n \n\n \n [](#example-0a5e92f2) In the following example,\n assuming the `<block>` is a start-aligned preformatted block\n ([display: block; white-space: pre; text-align: start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display)),\n every other line is right-aligned: \n\n```\n<block style=\"unicode-bidi: plaintext\">\nfrançais\nفارسی\nfrançais\nفارسی\nfrançais\nفارسی\n</block>\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-a82b4049) Because neutral characters (such as punctuation)\n and isolated runs are skipped\n when [finding the inline base direction of a plaintext bidi paragraph](http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#P2),\n the line box in the following example will be left-to-right\n (and thus left-aligned given [text-align: start](#propdef-text-align)),\n as dictated by the first strong character, ‘h’: \n\n```\n<para style=\"display: block; direction: rtl; unicode-bidi:plaintext\">\n“<quote style=\"unicode-bidi:plaintext\">שלום!</quote>”, they said.\n</para>\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-478dd3e8) \n\n```\n<textarea style=\"direction: rtl; unicode-bidi:plaintext\">\n\nHello!\n\n</textarea>\n\n```\n\n \nBecause of [unicode-bidi: plaintext](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-unicode-bidi),\n the “Hello!” is typeset LTR\n (i.e. with the exclamation mark on the right side)\n and left-aligned,\n ignoring the containing block’s RTL [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction).\n This makes the empty line following it LTR as well,\n which means that a caret on that line should appear at its left edge.\n The empty first line, however, is right-aligned:\n having no preceding line,\n it assumes the RTL direction of its containing block.",

[[ISO15924]](#biblio-iso15924)\n\n \n [](#example-a2325afd) Some common/historical examples of using BCP47 tags with script subtags: \n \n `zh-Latn` \n Chinese, written in Latin transcription. \n `ko-Hani` \n Korean, written in Hanja (Chinese ideographic characters). \n `tr-Arab` \n Turkish, written in Arabic script. \n `mn-Cyrl` \n Mongolian, written in Cyrillic. \n `mn-Mong` \n Mongolian, written in traditional Mongolian script. \n \n \n \nHowever, BCP47 script subtags are not typically used\n (and are in fact discouraged)\n for languages strongly associated with a single writing system:\n instead that writing system is expected to be implied\n when no other is specified. [[BCP47]](#biblio-bcp47) IANA maintains a database of various languages’ most common writing system\n via the `Suppress-Script` field in its [language subtag registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) for this purpose.\n\n \nNote: More advice on language tagging can be found in\n the [Internationalization Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/core/)’s [“Language tags in HTML and XML”](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/) and [“Choosing a Language Tag”](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags).\n\n \nWhen no writing system is explicitly indicated,\n UAs should assume the most common writing system\n of the declared [content language](#content-language) for language-sensitive typographic behaviors\n such as line-breaking or justification.\n However, UAs must not assume that writing system\n if the author has explicitly declared a different one.\n If the UA has no language-specific knowledge\n of a particular language and writing system combination,\n it must use the typographic conventions of the declared writing system\n (assuming the conventions of a different language if necessary),\n not the conventions of the declared language in an assumed writing system,\n which would be inappropriate to the declared writing system.\n\n \nThe full correspondence between languages and their most common writing systems\n is out of scope for this document.\n However, user agents must assume at least the following:\n\n \n\n If the [content language](#content-language) is Chinese and the [writing system](#content-writing-system) is unspecified,\n or for any content language if the writing system to specified to be one of the Hant, Hans, Hani, Hanb,\n or Bopo ISO script codes,\n then the writing system is **Chinese**. \n If the [content language](#content-language) is Japanese and the [writing system](#content-writing-system) is unspecified,\n or for any content language if the writing system to specified to be one of the Jpan, Hrkt, Hira,\n or Kana ISO script codes,\n then the writing system is **Japanese**. \n If the [content language](#content-language) is Korean and the [writing system](#content-writing-system) is unspecified,\n or for any content language if the writing system to specified to be one of the Kore, Hang,\n or Jamo ISO script codes,\n then the writing system is **Korean**. \n \n The [writing system](#content-writing-system) is only considered\n to be **unknown** if the [content language](#content-language) itself is unknown,\n or if it explicitly indicates an unknown writing system. \n \nNote: Mere omission of the [writing system](#content-writing-system) information\n when the [content language](#content-language) is declared\n means the that the writing system is implied, not unknown.",
