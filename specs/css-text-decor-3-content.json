      "content": "The following properties describe line decorations that are added to the content of an element.\n When specified on or propagated to an [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box),\n that [box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box) becomes a **decorating box** for that decoration,\n applying the decoration to all its [fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#fragment).\n The decoration is then further propagated to any [in-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#in-flow) [block-level](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#block-level) boxes that split the inline\n (see [CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level)).\n When specified on or propagated to a [block container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#block-container) that establishes an [inline formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-formatting-context),\n the decorations are propagated to an [anonymous](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#anonymous) inline box that wraps all the in-flow [inline-level](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-level) children of the block container.\n When specified on or propagated to a [ruby container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-container),\n the decorations are propagated only to the [ruby base](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-base-box).\n For all other box types,\n the decorations are propagated to all in-flow children.\n\n \n Note that text decorations are not propagated to any out-of-flow descendants,\n nor to the contents of atomic inline-level descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.\n They are also not propagated to inline children of inline boxes,\n although the decoration is applied to such boxes. \n\n \nUnderlines, overlines, and line-throughs are drawn only for [non-replaced](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#non-replaced) [inline boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box),\n and are drawn across all text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing)\n except spacing (white space, letter spacing, and word spacing) at the beginning and end of a line. [Atomic inlines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#atomic-inline), such as images and inline blocks, are not decorated.\n Margins, borders, and padding of the [decorating box](#decorating-box) are always skipped,\n however the margins, border, and padding of descendant inline boxes are not.\n\n \n Note that CSS 2.1 required skipping margins, borders, and padding always.\n In this level, by default only the margins, borders, and padding of the [decorating box](#decorating-box) are skipped.\n In the future CSS2.1 may be updated to match this new default.\n Also, control over decorating leading/trailing spaces is expected in Level 4,\n and will be applied by default to the HTML `[ins](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-ins-element)` and `[del](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-del-element)` elements. \n\n \nUAs may interrupt underlines and overlines where the line would cross glyph ink\n and to some distance to either side of the glyph outline;\n this behavior is not controllable in this level,\n but will be further defined in Level 4.\n Line-throughs must remain continuous, however.\n\n \n \n \nSkipping Glyph Ink \n\n \n \nWhen the UA interrupts underlines or overlines at glyph boundaries,\n the shape of the line at that boundary should\n follow the shape of the glyph.\n\n \n Note, this specification intentionally does not mandate a particular method\n for “following the shape” of the glyph\n so that UAs can take appropriate measures to handle\n aesthetic and performance considerations.\n For example,\n a UA could assume square line endings below a certain size threshold\n for performance reasons;\n or use trapezoidal endings to approximate curves,\n especially on thinner line decorations.\n In terms of aesthetic considerations,\n the UA might also consider what happens when the glyph boundary\n intersects only part of the line thickness\n or is slanted close to the horizontal—following the curve exactly\n could result in typographically-awkward wisps of underline.\n Whether to show the line within enclosed areas of a glyph is yet\n another consideration. \n \n \n \n Hiding the portion of the underline within the bowl gives a cleaner look to the type,\n while the curved ends of the underline outside it\n suggest the continuity of the underline through the letter\n by hugging its outer contour. \n\n \n \n \nRelatively positioning a descendant moves all text decorations\n applied to it along with the descendant’s text; it does not affect\n calculation of the decoration’s initial position on that line.\n The [visibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-visibility) property, [text-shadow](#propdef-text-shadow), filters, and other graphical transformations\n likewise also affect all text decorations applied to that box—including decorations propagated from an ancestor box—and do not affect the calculation of their initial positions or thicknesses.\n (In the case of line decorations drawn over an atomic inline\n or across the margins/borders/padding of a non-replaced inline box,\n they are analogously associated with the affected atomic inline / non-replaced inline box\n rather than with the [decorating box](#decorating-box).)\n\n \n [](#example-d6d0ccd7) In the following style sheet and document fragment: \n\n```\nblockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }\nem { display: block; }\ncite { color: fuchsia; }\n\n```\n\n```\n<blockquote>\n <p>\n <span>\n Help, help!\n <em> I am under a hat! </em>\n\n <cite> —GwieF </cite>\n </span>\n </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n```\n\n \n...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an\n anonymous inline box that surrounds the span element, causing\n the text \"Help, help!\" to be blue, with the blue underlining from\n the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the\n blockquote element. The `<em>text</em>` in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to\n which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,\n but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the\n anonymous inline element. This diagram shows the boxes involved in the example above. The\n rounded aqua line represents the anonymous inline element wrapping\n the inline contents of the paragraph element, the rounded blue line\n represents the span element, and the orange lines represent the\n blocks.\n\n \n \nNote: Line decorations are propagated through the box tree,\n not through inheritance,\n and thus have no effect on descendants\n when specified on an element with [display: contents](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display).\n\n 2.1.

It is also often useful for mathematical or chemical\n texts that use many subscripts. \n\n```\n:root { text-underline-position: under; }\n```\n\n \n \nNote: The under value does not guarantee\n that the underline will not conflict with glyphs,\n as some fonts have descenders or diacritics\n that extend below the font’s descent metrics.\n\n **left** \n In vertical [typographic modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#typographic-mode), the underline is aligned as for [under](#underline-under), except it is always aligned to the left edge of the text.\n If this causes the underline to be drawn on the \"over\" side of\n the text, then an overline also switches sides and is drawn on\n the \"under\" side. \n **right** \n In vertical [typographic modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#typographic-mode), the underline is aligned as for [under](#underline-under), except it is always aligned to the right edge of the text.\n If this causes the underline to be drawn on the \"over\" side of\n the text, then an overline also switches sides and is drawn on\n the \"under\" side. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [left](#underline-left) \n [right](#underline-right) \n \n \nIn vertical [typographic modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#typographic-mode), the [text-underline-position](#propdef-text-underline-position) values [left](#underline-left) and [right](#underline-right) allow placing the underline on either\n side of the text. (In horizontal typographic modes, both values are\n treated as [auto](#underline-auto).) \n\n \n \nThe exact position and thickness of line decorations is UA-defined in this level.\n However, for underlines and overlines\n the UA must use a single thickness and position on each line\n for the decorations deriving from a single [decorating box](#decorating-box).\n\n \n vs. \n \nCorrect and incorrect rendering of `<u>A<sup>B</sup><big>C</big>D</u>` \n\n \n \n Note, since line decorations can span elements with varying font sizes and\n vertical alignments, the best position for a line decoration is not\n necessarily the ideal position dictated by the [decorating box](#decorating-box).\n For example, an overline positioned to a small font\n will effectively become a line-through if the element contains text in a significantly larger font-size.\n Even for underlines, if the text is not aligned to the alphabetic baseline\n (for example, in vertical typesetting styles,\n text is aligned by its central baseline by default [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4))\n an underline will cut through descendant text of a larger font-size.\n UA consideration of descendant content will therefore result in better typography. \n \n \n \n Due to the central baseline alignment of vertical text,\n a left-side underline on small vertical text will cut through the text\n of a child with a larger font size.\n The underline is not allowed to be broken,\n but adjusting its position further to the left\n properly accommodates all of the underlined text. \n\n \n \n \nUAs must adjust line positions\n to match the shifted metrics of [decorating boxes](#decorating-box) shifted\n with [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) values other than [baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#valdef-alignment-baseline-baseline) [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) or subscripted/superscripted via [font-variant-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-variant-position) [[CSS-FONTS-3]](#biblio-css-fonts-3),\n but must not adjust the line position or thickness\n in response to descendants of a decorating box that are so styled.\n This allows superscripts and subscripts to be properly decorated\n (underlined, struck through, etc.)\n but prevents them from distorting or breaking the positioning of such decorations on their ancestors.\n\n \n \n \nExample of underline applied to superscripted text vs. underline applied to text containing a superscript \n\n \n \nSome font formats (such as OpenType) can offer information\n about the appropriate position of a line decoration.\n The UA should use such information\n (such as the underline thickness,\n or appropriate alphabetic underline position)\n from the font wherever appropriate.\n\n \nNote: Typically, OpenType font metrics give the position\n of an alphabetic underline;\n in some cases (especially in CJK fonts),\n it gives the position of a under left underline.\n (In this case, the font’s underline metrics typically\n touch the bottom edge of the em box).\n The UA may but is not required to correct for incorrect font metrics.",
