      "content": "This subsection is not normative. \n\n \nCSS describes how each element\n and each string of text in a source document\n is laid out by transforming the [element tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#element-tree) into a set of [boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box),\n whose size, position, and stacking level on the [canvas](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#canvas) depend on the values of their CSS properties. \n\n \nNote: [CSS Cascading and Inheritance](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/) describes how properties are assigned to elements in the box tree,\n while [CSS Display 3 § 1 Introduction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#intro) describes how the [element tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#element-tree) is transformed into the [box tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box-tree).\n\n \nEach CSS [box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box) has a rectangular content area,\n a band of padding around the content,\n a border around the padding,\n and a margin outside the border.\n The [sizing properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#sizing-property) [[css-sizing-3]](#biblio-css-sizing-3),\n together with various other properties that control layout,\n define the size of the content area.\n The box styling properties—​[padding](#propdef-padding) and its longhands, [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border) and its longhands,\n and [margin](#propdef-margin) and its longhands—​define the sizes of these other areas. \n\n \n[Margins](#margin) and [padding](#padding) are defined in this module. [Borders](#border) are similarly defined in [[css-backgrounds-3]](#biblio-css-backgrounds-3).\n\n \nNote: This module only defines the [physical](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#physical) per-side [longhand](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#longhand) properties.\n Additional, [flow-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#flow-relative) longhand properties\n are defined in [[css-logical-1]](#biblio-css-logical-1).\n Note that both sets of longhand properties control the same [margins](#margin)/[padding](#padding):\n they are just different ways of indexing each side.\n\n \n History of CSS Box module and the definition of Block Layout\n \nThis module [originally contained](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-css3-box-20180731/) the CSS Level 3 specification prose relating to\n box generation (now defined in [[css-display-3]](#biblio-css-display-3)),\n the box model (defined here),\n as well as block layout (now only defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) Chapters 9 and 10).\n Since its maintenance was put aside during the development of CSS2.1,\n its prose was severely outdated by the time CSS2 Revision 1\n was finally completed.\n Therefore, the block layout portion of the prose has been retired,\n to be re-synched to [CSS2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2) and updated\n as input to a new Block Layout module at some point in the future.\n It is being split apart from this module\n and from the [CSS Display Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display/) both because of the practical concern that it would be a huge amount of work\n and also in recognition that CSS now has multiple layout models\n ([Flex Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/), [Grid Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid/), [Positioned Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position/),\n and [Table Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables/),\n in addition to Block Layout)\n which each deserve their own parallel module. \n\n \n 1.1. Value Definitions[](#values)\n \nThis specification follows the [CSS property definition conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) using the [value definition syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs) from [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [CSS-VALUES-3].\n Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.\n\n \nIn addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,\n all properties defined in this specification\n also accept the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) as their property value.\n For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.\n\n 1.2. Module Interactions[](#placement)\n \nThis module replaces the definitions of the margin and padding properties\n defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 (but not 8.3.1), and 8.4. \n\n \nAll properties in this module apply to the [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) and [::first-letter](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-letter) pseudo-elements.",

      "content": "Each box has a **content area** (which contains its content—​text, descendant boxes, an image or other [replaced element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#replaced-element) content, etc.)\n and optional surrounding **padding**, **border**,\n and **margin areas**;\n the size of each area is specified by corresponding properties,\n and can be zero\n (or in the case of margins, negative).\n The following diagram shows how these areas relate\n and the terminology used to refer to the various parts of the box: \n\n \n \n \n\n \nThe various areas and edges of a typical box. \n\n \n \nThe background of the content, padding, and border areas of a box\n is specified by its [background](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background) properties.\n The border area can additionally be painted with a border style\n using the [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border) properties.\n Margins are always transparent.\n See [[css-backgrounds-3]](#biblio-css-backgrounds-3).\n\n \nThe margin, border, and padding can be broken down into\n top, right, bottom, and left segments,\n each of which can be controlled independently\n by its corresponding property.\n\n 2.1. Boxes and Edges[](#box-edges)\n \nThe perimeter of each of the four areas\n (content, padding, border, and margin)\n is called an **edge**,\n and each [edge](#box-box-edge) can be broken down into\n a top, right, bottom, and left side.\n Thus each [box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box) has four edges each composed of four sides:\n\n \n **content edge** or **inner edge** \n The content edge surrounds\n the rectangle given by the width and height of the box,\n which often depend on the element’s content\n and/or its [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#containing-block) size.\n The four sides of the [content edge](#content-edge) together\n define the box’s **content box**. \n **padding edge** \n The padding edge surrounds\n the box’s padding.\n If the padding has zero width on a given side,\n the padding edge coincides with the content edge on that side.\n The four sides of the [padding edge](#padding-edge) together\n define the box’s **padding box**,\n which contains both the [content](#content-area) and [padding areas](#padding-area). \n **border edge** \n The border edge surrounds the box’s border.\n If the border has zero width on a given side,\n the border edge coincides with the padding edge on that side.\n The four sides of the [border edge](#border-edge) together\n define the box’s **border box**,\n which contains the box’s [content](#content-area), [padding](#padding-area),\n and [border areas](#border-area). \n **margin edge** or **outer edge** \n The margin edge surrounds the box’s margin.\n If the margin has zero width on a given side,\n the margin edge coincides with the border edge on that side.\n The four sides of the [margin edge](#margin-edge) together\n define the box’s **margin box**,\n which contains the all of the box’s [content](#content-area), [padding](#padding-area), [border](#border-area),\n and [margin areas](#margin-area). \n \n 2.2. Fragmentation[](#fragmentation)\n \nWhen a box [fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#fragmentation-model)—​is broken, as across lines or across pages, into separate [box fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment)—​each of its boxes\n ([content box](#content-box), [padding box](#padding-box), [border box](#border-box), [margin box](#margin-box))\n also fragments.\n How the content/padding/border/margin areas react to fragmentation\n is specified in [[css-break-3]](#biblio-css-break-3) and controlled by the [box-decoration-break](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#propdef-box-decoration-break) property.\n\n 2.3. Box-edge Keywords[](#keywords)\n \nThe following **[<box>](#typedef-box)** CSS keywords are defined for use\n in properties (such as [transform-box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#propdef-transform-box) and [background-clip](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-clip))\n that need to refer to various box edges:\n\n \n ,,,,,\n,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-content-box\">content-box \n Refers to the [content box](#content-box) or [content edge](#content-edge).\n (In an SVG context, treated as [fill-box](#valdef-box-fill-box).) \n ,,,,,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-padding-box\">padding-box \n Refers to the [padding box](#padding-box) or [padding edge](#padding-edge).\n (In an SVG context, treated as [fill-box](#valdef-box-fill-box).) \n ,,,,,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-border-box\">border-box \n Refers to the [border box](#border-box) or [border edge](#border-edge).\n (In an SVG context, treated as [stroke-box](#valdef-box-stroke-box).) \n ,,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-margin-box\">margin-box \n Refers to the [margin box](#margin-box) or [margin edge](#margin-edge).\n (In an SVG context, treated as [stroke-box](#valdef-box-stroke-box).) \n ,,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-fill-box\">fill-box \n Refers to the [object bounding box](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermObjectBoundingBox) or its edges.\n (In a CSS box context, treated as [content-box](#valdef-box-content-box).) \n ,,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-stroke-box\">stroke-box \n Refers to the [stroke bounding box](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermStrokeBoundingBox) or its edges.\n (In a CSS box context, treated as [border-box](#valdef-box-border-box).) \n ,,\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-box-view-box\">view-box \n \n Refers to the nearest [SVG viewport](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermSVGViewport) element’s **origin box**,\n which is a rectangle with the width and height\n of the initial SVG [user coordinate system](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermUserCoordinateSystem) established by the `[viewBox](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermViewBox)` attribute for that element,\n positioned such that its top left corner is anchored\n at the coordinate system origin.\n (In a CSS box context, treated as [border-box](#valdef-box-border-box).) \n Note: When the `[viewBox](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermViewBox)` includes non-zero min-x or min-y offsets,\n this [origin box](#svg-viewport-origin-box) does not actually correspond\n to the visible region rectangle defined by the `[viewBox](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermViewBox)`!\n\n \n \nFor convenience, the following value types are defined\n to represents commonly used subsets of [<box>](#typedef-box):\n\n```\n**[<visual-box>](#typedef-visual-box)** = content-box [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) padding-box [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) border-box\n**[<layout-box>](#typedef-layout-box)** = [<visual-box>](#typedef-visual-box) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) margin-box\n**[<paint-box>](#typedef-paint-box)** = [<visual-box>](#typedef-visual-box) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) fill-box [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) stroke-box\n**[<coord-box>](#typedef-coord-box)** = [<paint-box>](#typedef-paint-box) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) view-box\n\n```",
