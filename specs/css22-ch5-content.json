For `lang` (or\n`xml:lang`) language subcode matching, please see [the `:lang` pseudo-class](#lang).\n\nAttribute values must be identifiers or strings. The\ncase-sensitivity of attribute names and values in selectors depends on\nthe document language.\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, the following attribute selector \nmatches all H1 elements that specify the \"title\" attribute, \nwhatever its value:\n\n```\n\nh1[title] { color: blue; }\n\n```\n\nExample(s):\n\nIn the following example, the selector matches all SPAN elements whose\n\"class\" attribute has exactly the value \"example\":\n\n```\n\nspan[class=example] { color: blue; }\n\n```\n\nMultiple attribute selectors can be used to refer to several\nattributes of an element, or even several times to the same attribute.\n\nExample(s):\n\nHere, the selector matches all SPAN elements whose\n\"hello\" attribute has exactly the value \"Cleveland\" and whose\n\"goodbye\" attribute has exactly the value \"Columbus\":\n\n```\n\nspan[hello=\"Cleveland\"][goodbye=\"Columbus\"] { color: blue; }\n\n```\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following selectors illustrate the differences between \"=\" and \"~=\".\nThe first selector will match, for example, the value \n\"copyright copyleft copyeditor\" for the \"rel\" attribute.

Thus, for HTML,\n`div.value` and `div[class~=value]` have the\nsame meaning. The attribute value must immediately follow the\n\"period\" (`.`). UAs may apply selectors using the\nperiod (.) notation in XML documents if the UA has namespace specific\nknowledge that allows it to determine which attribute is the\n\"class\" attribute for the respective namespace. One such\nexample of namespace specific knowledge is the prose in the\nspecification for a particular namespace (e.g., SVG 1.1 [[SVG11]](refs.html#ref-SVG11)\ndescribes the [SVG\n\"class\" attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-SVG11-20030114/styling.html#ClassAttribute) and how a UA should interpret it, and\nsimilarly MathML 3.0 [[MATH30]](refs.html#ref-MATH30) describes the [MathML\n\"class\" attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter2.html#fund.globatt).)\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, we can assign style information to all elements with\nclass~=\"pastoral\" as follows:\n\n```\n\n*.pastoral { color: green } /* all elements with class~=pastoral */\n\n```\n\nor just\n\n```\n\n.pastoral { color: green } /* all elements with class~=pastoral */\n\n```\n\nThe following assigns style only to H1 elements with\nclass~=\"pastoral\":\n\n```\n\nH1.pastoral { color: green } /* H1 elements with class~=pastoral */\n\n```\n\nGiven these rules, the first H1 instance below would not have green\ntext, while the second would:\n\n```\n\n<H1>Not green</H1>\n<H1 class=\"pastoral\">Very green</H1>\n\n```\n\nTo match a subset of \"class\" values, each value must be preceded\nby a \".\".\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, the following rule matches any P element whose \"class\" attribute\nhas been assigned a list of space-separated values that includes \"pastoral\"\nand \"marine\":\n\n```\n \np.marine.pastoral { color: green }\n\n```\n\nThis rule matches when class=\"pastoral blue aqua\nmarine\" but does not match for class=\"pastoral\nblue\".\n\n Note. CSS gives so much\npower to the \"class\" attribute, that authors could conceivably design\ntheir own \"document language\" based on elements with almost no\nassociated presentation (such as DIV and SPAN in HTML) and assigning\nstyle information through the \"class\" attribute. Authors should avoid\nthis practice since the structural elements of a document language\noften have recognized and accepted meanings and author-defined classes may\nnot.\n\nNote: If an element has\nmultiple class attributes, their values must be concatenated with\nspaces between the values before searching for the class. As of this\ntime the working group is not aware of any manner in which this\nsituation can be reached, however, so this behavior is explicitly\nnon-normative in this specification.",

      "content": "Document languages may contain attributes that are declared to be\nof type ID. What makes attributes of type ID special is that no two\nsuch attributes can have the same value; whatever the document\nlanguage, an ID attribute can be used to uniquely identify its\nelement. In HTML all ID attributes are named \"id\"; XML\napplications may name ID attributes differently, but the\nsame restriction applies.\n\nThe ID attribute of a document language allows authors to assign an\nidentifier to one element instance in the document tree. CSS ID\nselectors match an element instance based on its identifier. A CSS\nID selector contains a \"#\" immediately followed by the ID\nvalue, which must be an identifier.\n\nNote that CSS does not specify how a UA knows the ID\nattribute of an element. The UA may, e.g., read a document's DTD, have\nthe information hard-coded or ask the user.\n\nExample(s):\n\n \nThe following ID selector matches the H1 element whose ID\nattribute has the value \"chapter1\":\n\n```\n\nh1#chapter1 { text-align: center }\n\n```\n\n \nIn the following example, the style rule matches\nthe element that has the ID value \"z98y\".\nThe rule will thus match for the P element:\n\n```\n\n<HEAD>\n <TITLE>Match P</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n *#z98y { letter-spacing: 0.3em }\n </STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\n <P id=z98y>Wide text</P>\n</BODY>\n\n```\n\nIn the next example, however, the style rule will only match an H1\nelement that has an ID value of \"z98y\". The rule will not match the\nP element in this example:\n\n```\n\n<HEAD>\n <TITLE>Match H1 only</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n H1#z98y { letter-spacing: 0.5em }\n </STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\n <P id=z98y>Wide text</P>\n</BODY>\n\n```\n\nID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.\nFor example, in HTML, the selector #p123 is more specific\nthan [id=p123] in terms of the [cascade](cascade.html).\n\nNote. In XML 1.1 [[XML11]](refs.html#ref-XML11), the information about which\nattribute contains an element's IDs is contained in a DTD. When\nparsing XML, UAs do not always read the DTD, and thus may not know\nwhat the ID of an element is. If a style sheet designer knows or\nsuspects that this will be the case, he should use normal attribute\nselectors instead: `[name=p371]` instead of\n`#p371`. However, the cascading order of normal attribute\nselectors is different from ID selectors. It may be necessary to add\nan \"!important\" priority to the declarations: `[name=p371]\n{color: red ! important}`.\n\nIf an element has multiple ID attributes, all of them must be\ntreated as IDs for that element for the purposes of the ID\nselector. Such a situation could be reached using mixtures of xml:id\n[[XMLID]](refs.html#ref-XMLID), DOM3 Core [[DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]](refs.html#ref-DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE), XML DTDs [[XML11]](refs.html#ref-XML11) and\nnamespace-specific knowledge.",

      "content": "Interactive user agents sometimes change the rendering in response\nto user actions. CSS provides three pseudo-classes for common cases:\n\n The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an\nelement (with some pointing device), but does not activate it. For\nexample, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the\ncursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element.\nUser agents not supporting\n[interactive media](media.html#interactive-media-group)\ndo not have to support this pseudo-class.\nSome conforming user agents supporting\n[interactive media](media.html#interactive-media-group)\nmay not be able to support this pseudo-class (e.g., a pen device).\n\n The :active pseudo-class applies while an element is being\nactivated by the user. For example, between the times the user presses\nthe mouse button and releases it.\n\n The :focus pseudo-class applies while an element has the\nfocus (accepts keyboard events or other forms of text input).\n\nAn element may match several pseudo-classes at the same time.\n\nCSS does not define which elements may be in the above states, or\nhow the states are entered and left. Scripting may change whether\nelements react to user events or not, and different devices and UAs\nmay have different ways of pointing to, or activating elements.\n\nCSS 2.2 does not define if the parent of an element that is\n':active' or ':hover' is also in that state.\n\nUser agents are not required to reflow a currently displayed\ndocument due to pseudo-class transitions. For instance, a style sheet\nmay specify that the ['font-size'](fonts.html#propdef-font-size) of an :active link\nshould be larger than that of an inactive link, but since this may\ncause letters to change position when the reader selects the link, a\nUA may ignore the corresponding style rule.\n\nExample(s):\n\n```\n\na:link { color: red } /* unvisited links */\na:visited { color: blue } /* visited links */\na:hover { color: yellow } /* user hovers */\na:active { color: lime } /* active links */\n\n```\n\nNote that the A:hover must be placed after the A:link and A:visited\nrules, since otherwise the cascading rules will hide the ['color'](colors.html#propdef-color) property of the A:hover\nrule. Similarly, because A:active is placed after A:hover, the active\ncolor (lime) will apply when the user both activates and hovers over\nthe A element.\n\nExample(s):\n\nAn example of combining dynamic pseudo-classes:\n\n```\n\na:focus { background: yellow }\na:focus:hover { background: white }\n\n```\n\nThe last selector matches A elements that are in pseudo-class\n:focus and in pseudo-class :hover.\n\n \n\nFor information about the presentation of focus outlines, please\nconsult the section on [dynamic\nfocus outlines](ui.html#dynamic-outlines).\n\nNote.\nIn CSS1, the ':active' pseudo-class was mutually\nexclusive with ':link' and ':visited'. That is no longer the case. An\nelement can be both ':visited' and ':active' (or ':link' and\n':active') and the normal cascading rules determine which style\ndeclarations\napply.\n\nNote.\nAlso note that in CSS1, the ':active' pseudo-class only applied to\nlinks.",

      "content": "If the document language specifies how the human language of an element is\ndetermined, it is possible to write selectors in CSS that match an\nelement based on its language. For example, in HTML [[HTML4]](refs.html#ref-HTML4), the\nlanguage is determined by a combination of the \"lang\" attribute, the\nMETA element, and possibly by information from the protocol (such as\nHTTP headers). XML uses an attribute called xml:lang, and there may be\nother document language-specific methods for determining the language.\n\nThe pseudo-class ':lang(C)' matches if the element is in language\nC. Whether there is a match is based solely on the identifier C\nbeing either equal to, or a hyphen-separated substring of, the\nelement's language value, in the same way as if performed by the ['|='](#attribute-selectors) operator. The matching of C\nagainst the element's language value is performed case-insensitively\nfor characters within the ASCII range.\nThe identifier C does not have to be a valid language name.\n\nC must not be empty.\n\nNote: It is recommended that documents and\nprotocols indicate language using codes from BCP 47 [[BCP47]](refs.html#ref-BCP47) or\nits successor, and by means of \"xml:lang\" attributes in the case of\nXML-based documents [[XML11]](refs.html#ref-XML11). See [\n\"FAQ: Two-letter or three-letter language codes.\"](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-2or3)\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following rules set the quotation marks for an HTML document\nthat is either in Canadian French or German:\n\n```\n\nhtml:lang(fr-ca) { quotes: '« ' ' »' }\nhtml:lang(de) { quotes: '»' '«' '\\2039' '\\203A' }\n:lang(fr) > Q { quotes: '« ' ' »' }\n:lang(de) > Q { quotes: '»' '«' '\\2039' '\\203A' }\n\n```\n\nThe second pair of rules actually set the ['quotes'](generate.html#propdef-quotes) property on Q elements\naccording to the language of its parent. This is done because the\nchoice of quote marks is typically based on the language of the\nelement around the quote, not the quote itself: like this piece of\nFrench “&agrave; l'improviste” in the middle of an English\ntext uses the English quotation marks. \n\n Note the difference between [lang|=xx] and\n :lang(xx). In this HTML example, only the BODY matches [lang|=fr]\n (because it has a LANG attribute) but both the BODY and the P match\n :lang(fr) (because both are in French).\n\n \n```\n<body lang=fr>\n <p>Je suis Fran&ccedil;ais.</p>\n</body>\n```",

However, the selector \"P:first-line\"\ndoes not match any real HTML element. It does match a pseudo-element\nthat [conforming user agents](conform.html#conformance)\nwill insert at the beginning of every paragraph.\n\nNote that the length of the first line depends on a number of\nfactors, including the width of the page, the font size, etc. Thus,\nan ordinary HTML paragraph such as:\n\n```\n\n<P>This is a somewhat long HTML \nparagraph that will be broken into several \nlines.

E.g., the first\nline of the DIV in `<DIV><P>This\nline...</P></DIV>` is the first line of the P (assuming\nthat both P and DIV are block-level).\n\nThe first line of a table-cell or inline-block cannot be the first\nformatted line of an ancestor element. Thus, in `<DIV><P\nSTYLE=\"display: inline-block\">Hello<BR>Goodbye</P>\netcetera</DIV>` the first formatted line of the DIV is not\nthe line \"Hello\".\n\nNote that the first line of the P in this fragment:\n`<p><br>First...` does not contain any letters\n(assuming the default style for BR in HTML 4). The word \"First\" is\nnot on the first formatted line.\n\nA UA should act as if the fictional start tags of the first-line\npseudo-elements were nested just inside the innermost enclosing\nblock-level element. (Since CSS1 and CSS2 were silent on this case,\nauthors should not rely on this behavior.) Here is an example.

The :first-letter\npseudo-element may be used for \"initial caps\" and \"drop caps\", which are common typographical effects. This\ntype of initial letter is similar to an inline-level element if its\n['float'](visuren.html#propdef-float) property is 'none',\notherwise it is similar to a floated element.\n\nThese are the properties that apply to :first-letter pseudo-elements:\n[font properties,](fonts.html) \n['text-decoration',](text.html#propdef-text-decoration)\n['text-transform',](text.html#propdef-text-transform)\n['letter-spacing',](text.html#propdef-letter-spacing)\n['word-spacing'](text.html#propdef-word-spacing) (when appropriate),\n['line-height',](visudet.html#propdef-line-height)\n['float',](visuren.html#propdef-float)\n['vertical-align'](visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align) (only if 'float' is 'none'), \n[margin properties,](box.html#margin-properties)\n[padding properties,](box.html#padding-properties)\n[border properties,](box.html#border-properties)\n[color property,](colors.html)\n[background properties.](colors.html#background-properties)\nUAs may apply other properties as well.\nTo allow UAs to render a typographically correct drop cap or initial\ncap, the UA may choose a line-height, width and height based on the\nshape of the letter, unlike for normal elements. CSS3 is expected to\nhave specific properties that apply to first-letter.\n\nThis example shows a possible rendering of an initial cap. Note\nthat the 'line-height' that is inherited by the first-letter\npseudo-element is 1.1, but the UA in this example has computed the\nheight of the first letter differently, so that it does not cause any\nunnecessary space between the first two lines. Also note that the\nfictional start tag of the first letter is inside the SPAN, and thus\nthe font weight of the first letter is normal, not bold as the SPAN:\n\n```\n\np { line-height: 1.1 }\np:first-letter { font-size: 3em; font-weight: normal }\nspan { font-weight: bold }\n...\n<p><span>Het hemelsche</span> gerecht heeft zich ten lange lesten<br>\nErbarremt over my en mijn benaeuwde vesten<br>\nEn arme burgery, en op mijn volcx gebed<br>\nEn dagelix geschrey de bange stad ontzet.\n\n```\n\nThe following CSS 2.2 will make a drop cap initial letter span about two lines:\n\n```\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">\n<HTML>\n <HEAD>\n <TITLE>Drop cap initial letter</TITLE>\n <STYLE type=\"text/css\">\n P { font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.2 }\n P:first-letter { font-size: 200%; font-style: italic;\n font-weight: bold; float: left }\n SPAN { text-transform: uppercase }\n </STYLE>\n </HEAD>\n <BODY>\n <P><SPAN>The first</SPAN> few words of an article\n in The Economist.</P>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n```\n\nThis example might be formatted as follows:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/first-letter-desc.html)\n\nThe fictional tag sequence is:\n\n```\n\n<P>\n<SPAN>\n<P:first-letter>\nT\n</P:first-letter>he first\n</SPAN> \nfew words of an article in the Economist.\n</P>\n\n```\n\nNote that the :first-letter pseudo-element tags abut the content\n(i.e., the initial character), while the :first-line pseudo-element\nstart tag is inserted right after the start tag of the block element.\n\nIn order to achieve traditional drop caps formatting, user agents\nmay approximate font sizes, for example to align baselines. Also, the\nglyph outline may be taken into account when formatting.\n\nPunctuation (i.e, characters defined in Unicode [[UNICODE]](refs.html#ref-UNICODE) in the\n\"open\" (Ps), \"close\" (Pe), \"initial\" (Pi). \"final\" (Pf) and \"other\"\n(Po) punctuation classes), that\nprecedes or follows the first letter should be included, as in:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/first-letter2-desc.html)\n\nThe ':first-letter' also applies if the first letter is in fact a\ndigit, e.g., the \"6\" in \"67 million dollars is a lot of money.\"\n\nThe :first-letter pseudo-element applies\nto [block container elements.](visuren.html#block-boxes)\n\nThe :first-letter pseudo-element can be used with all such elements that\ncontain text, or that have a descendant in the same flow that contains\ntext. A UA should act as if the fictional start tag of the\nfirst-letter pseudo-element is just before the first text of the\nelement, even if that first text is in a descendant.\n\nExample(s):\n\nHere is an example. The fictional tag sequence for this HTML\nfragment:\n\n```\n\n<div>\n<p>The first text.\n\n```\n\nis:\n\n```\n\n<div>\n<p><div:first-letter><p:first-letter>T</...></...>he first text.\n\n```\n\nThe first letter of a table-cell or inline-block cannot be the\nfirst letter of an ancestor element. Thus, in `<DIV><P\nSTYLE=\"display: inline-block\">Hello<BR>Goodbye</P>\netcetera</DIV>` the first letter of the DIV is not the\nletter \"H\". In fact, the DIV does not have a first letter.\n\nThe first letter must occur on the [first formatted line.](#first-formatted-line) For example, in\nthis fragment: `<p><br>First...` the first line\ndoes not contain any letters and ':first-letter' does not match anything\n(assuming the default style for BR in HTML 4). In particular, it\ndoes not match the \"F\" of \"First.\"\n\nIf an element is a [list item](generate.html#lists)\n('display: list-item'), the ':first-letter' applies to the first\nletter in the principal box after the marker. UAs may ignore\n':first-letter' on list items with 'list-style-position: inside'. If\nan element has ':before' or ':after' content, the ':first-letter\napplies to the first letter of the element including that\ncontent.\n\nE.g., after the rule 'p:before {content: \"Note: \"}', the selector\n'p:first-letter' matches the \"N\" of \"Note\".\n\nSome languages may have specific rules about how to treat certain\nletter combinations. In Dutch, for example, if the letter combination\n\"ij\" appears at the beginning of a word, both letters should be\nconsidered within the :first-letter pseudo-element.\n\nIf the letters that would form the first-letter are not in the same\nelement, such as \"'T\" in `<p>'<em>T...`, the UA may\ncreate a first-letter pseudo-element from one of the elements, both\nelements, or simply not create a pseudo-element.\n\nSimilarly, if the first letter(s) of the block are not at the start\nof the line (for example due to bidirectional reordering), then the UA\nneed not create the pseudo-element(s).\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following example illustrates\nhow overlapping pseudo-elements may interact. The first letter of\neach P element will be green with a font size of '24pt'. The rest of\nthe first formatted line will be 'blue' while the rest of the\nparagraph will be 'red'.\n\n```\n\np { color: red; font-size: 12pt }\np:first-letter { color: green; font-size: 200% }\np:first-line { color: blue }\n\n<P>Some text that ends up on two lines</P>\n\n```\n\nAssuming that a line break will occur before the word \"ends\", the\nfictional tag\nsequence for this fragment might be:\n\n```\n\n<P>\n<P:first-line>\n<P:first-letter> \nS \n</P:first-letter>ome text that \n</P:first-line> \nends up on two lines \n</P>\n\n```\n\nNote that the :first-letter element is inside the :first-line\nelement. Properties set on :first-line are inherited by\n:first-letter, but are overridden if the same property is set on\n:first-letter.",
