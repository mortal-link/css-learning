On occasion, however, style sheets for\ndifferent media types may share a property, but require different\nvalues for that property. For example, the ['font-size'](fonts.html#propdef-font-size) property is useful both\nfor screen and print media. The two media types are different enough\nto require different values for the common property; a document will\ntypically need a larger font on a computer screen than on paper.\nTherefore, it is necessary to express that a style sheet, or a\nsection of a style sheet, applies to certain media types.",

In the following list of CSS\nmedia types the names of media types are normative, but the\ndescriptions are informative. Likewise, the \"Media\" field in the \ndescription of each property is informative.\n\nall\nSuitable for all devices.\n\nbraille\nIntended for braille tactile feedback devices.\n\nembossed\nIntended for paged braille printers.\n\nhandheld\nIntended for handheld devices (typically small\nscreen, limited bandwidth).\n\nprint \nIntended for paged material and for documents viewed on\nscreen in print preview mode. Please consult the section on [paged media](page.html) for information about formatting\nissues that are specific to paged media.\n\nprojection\nIntended for projected presentations, for example projectors.\nPlease consult the section on [paged media](page.html) for\ninformation about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.\n\nscreen \nIntended primarily for color computer screens. \n\nspeech\nIntended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type \ncalled 'aural' for this purpose. See the appendix on \n[aural style sheets](./aural.html) for details. \n\ntty\nIntended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as\nteletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display\ncapabilities). Authors should not use [pixel units](syndata.html#length-units) with the \"tty\" media\ntype.\n\ntv\nIntended for television-type devices (low \nresolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available). \n\nMedia type names are case-insensitive. \n\nMedia types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent can\nonly support one media type when rendering a document. However, user\nagents may use different media types on different canvases. For\nexample, a document may (simultaneously) be shown in 'screen' mode on\none canvas and 'print' mode on another canvas. \n\nNote that a multimodal media type is still only one media\ntype. The 'tv' media type, for example, is a multimodal media\ntype that renders both visually and aurally to a single canvas.\n\n@media and @import rules with unknown media types (that are\nnonetheless valid identifiers) are treated as if the unknown media\ntypes are not present. If an @media/@import rule contains a malformed\nmedia type (not an identifier) then the statement is invalid.\n\nNote: Media Queries supercedes this\nerror handling.\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, in the following snippet, the rule on the P element applies\nin 'screen' mode (even though the '3D' media type is not known).\n\n```\n\n@media screen, 3D {\n P { color: green; }\n}\n\n```\n\nNote.\nFuture updates of CSS may extend the list of media types. Authors\nshould not rely on media type names that are not yet defined\nby a CSS specification.",
