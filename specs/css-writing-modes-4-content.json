      "content": "CSS Writing Modes Level 4 defines CSS features to support for various international\n writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. Latin or Indic), right-to-left\n (e.g. Hebrew or Arabic), bidirectional (e.g. mixed Latin and Arabic) and\n vertical (e.g. Asian scripts).\n\n \nA **writing mode** in CSS is determined by the [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode), [direction](#propdef-direction), and [text-orientation](#propdef-text-orientation) properties. It is defined primarily\n in terms of its [inline base direction](#inline-base-direction) and [block flow direction](#block-flow-direction): \n\n \n \n [ ](diagrams/text-flow-vectors-tb.svg)\n \nLatin-based writing mode \n\n \n \n [ ](diagrams/text-flow-vectors-lr-reverse.svg)\n \nMongolian-based writing mode \n\n \n \n [ ](diagrams/text-flow-vectors-tb.svg) [ ](diagrams/text-flow-vectors-rl.svg)\n \nHan-based writing mode \n\n \n \n \nThe **inline base direction** is the primary direction in which\n content is ordered on a line and defines on which sides the “start”\n and “end” of a line are. The [direction](#propdef-direction) property specifies the\n inline base direction of a box and, together with the [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) property and the inherent directionality of any text content, determines\n the ordering of inline-level content within a line. \n\n \nThe **block flow direction** is the direction in which\n block-level boxes stack and the direction in which line boxes stack\n within a block container. The [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode) property determines the\n block flow direction.\n\n \nThe **typographic mode** determines if text should apply\n typographic conventions specific to vertical flow for [vertical\n scripts](#vertical-script).\n This concept distinguishes vertical flow for vertical scripts from\n rotated horizontal flow. \n\n \nA **horizontal writing mode** is one with horizontal lines of\n text, i.e. a downward or upward block flow.\n A **vertical writing mode** is one with vertical lines of text,\n i.e. a leftward or rightward block flow. \n\n \nThese terms should not be confused with **vertical block flow[](#vertical-block-flow)** (which is a downward or\n upward block flow) and **horizontal block flow[](#horizontal-block-flow)** (which is\n leftward or rightward block flow). To avoid confusion, CSS\n specifications avoid this latter set of terms.\n\n \nWriting systems typically have one or two native writing modes. Some\n examples are: \n\n \n\n Latin-based systems are typically written using a left-to-right inline\n direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.\n Arabic-based systems are typically written using a right-to-left\n inline direction with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction.\n Mongolian-based systems are typically written using a top-to-bottom\n inline direction with a rightward (left-to-right) block flow direction.\n Han-based systems are commonly written using a left-to-right inline direction\n with a downward (top-to-bottom) block flow direction, or a top-to-bottom inline direction with a leftward (right-to-left) block\n flow direction. Many magazines and newspapers will mix these two writing\n modes on the same page.\n \n\n \nThe [text-orientation](#propdef-text-orientation) component of the writing mode\n controls the glyph orientation. \n\n \nSee Unicode Technical Note #22 [[UTN22]](#biblio-utn22) ([HTML version](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/vertical-text/paper))\n for a more in-depth introduction to writing modes and vertical text. \n\n 1.1. Module Interactions[](#placement)\n \nThis module replaces and extends the [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) and [direction](#propdef-direction) features defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) sections 8.6 and 9.10.\n The interaction of its features\n with other text operations\n in setting lines of text\n is described in [CSS Text 3 § Text Processing Order of Operations](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#order). \n\n \nThe [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/#computed-value) of the [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode), [direction](#propdef-direction), and [text-orientation](#propdef-text-orientation) properties\n (even on elements to which these properties themselves don’t apply [[CSS-CASCADE-4]](#biblio-css-cascade-4))\n are broadly able to influence the computed values of other, unrelated properties\n through calculations such as\n the computation of [font-relative lengths](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#font-relative-length) or the cascade of [flow-relative properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-logical-1/) which purposefully depend on the computed [writing mode](#writing-mode) or on font metrics that can depend on the writing mode. \n\n 1.2. Value Types and Terminology[](#values)\n \nThis specification follows the [CSS property definition conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.\n\n \nIn addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,\n all properties defined in this specification\n also accept the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) keywords as their property value.\n For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.\n\n \nOther important terminology and concepts used in this specification\n are defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) and [[CSS-TEXT-3]](#biblio-css-text-3).",

      "content": "While the characters in most scripts are written from left to right,\n certain scripts are written from right to left. In some documents,\n in particular those written with the Arabic or Hebrew script, and in\n some mixed-language contexts, text in a single (visually displayed)\n block may appear with mixed directionality. This phenomenon is called **bidirectionality[](#bidirectionality)**, or \"bidi\" for short.\n\n \n \n \n\n \nBidirectionality\n\n \n \nThe Unicode standard ([Unicode Standard Annex #9](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/)) defines a complex\n algorithm for determining the proper ordering of bidirectional text. The\n algorithm consists of an implicit part based on character properties,\n as well as explicit controls for embeddings and overrides. CSS relies\n on this algorithm to achieve proper bidirectional rendering. \n\n \nTwo CSS properties, [direction](#propdef-direction) and [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi),\n provide explicit embedding, isolation, and override controls in the CSS layer.\n Because the base directionality of a text depends on the structure and\n semantics of the document, the direction and unicode-bidi properties\n should in most cases be used only to map bidi information in the markup\n to its corresponding CSS styles. \n\n \n The HTML specifications ([[HTML401]](#biblio-html401), section 8.2, and [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5), section 10.3.5) define\n bidirectionality behavior for HTML elements.\n\n \n If a document language provides markup features to control\n bidi, authors and users should use those features instead and not specify CSS rules to override them. \n\n 2.1. Specifying Directionality: the [direction](#propdef-direction) property[](#direction)\n \n \n \n Name:\n **direction**\n \n [Value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#value-defs)\n ltr [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) rtl\n \n [Initial:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n ltr\n \n Applies to:\n [all elements](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo/#generated-content)\n \n [Inherited:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n yes\n \n [Percentages:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#percentages)\n n/a\n \n [Computed value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#computed)\n specified value\n \n Canonical order:\n n/a\n \n [Animation type:](https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable\n \n \nBecause HTML UAs can turn off CSS styling, we recommend HTML authors to use the HTML `dir` attribute and <bdo> element to ensure correct bidirectional layout in the absence of a style sheet. Authors should not use [direction](#propdef-direction) in HTML documents. \n\n \nThis property specifies the [inline base direction](#inline-base-direction) or directionality\n of any bidi paragraph, embedding, isolate, or override established by the box.\n (See [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi).)\n In addition, it informs the ordering of [table](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html) column layout,\n the direction of horizontal [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visufx.html#overflow),\n and the default alignment of text within a line, and other layout effects\n that depend on the box’s inline base direction.\n\n \nValues for this property have the following meanings:\n\n \n **ltr**\n This value sets [inline base direction](#inline-base-direction) (bidi directionality)\n to [line-left](#line-left)-to-[line-right](#line-right).\n **rtl**\n This value sets [inline base direction](#inline-base-direction) (bidi directionality)\n to [line-right](#line-right)-to-[line-left](#line-left).\n \n \nThe [direction](#propdef-direction) property has no effect on bidi reordering\n when specified on inline boxes whose [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) value is [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal),\n because the box does not open an additional level\n of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.\n\n \nThe [direction](#propdef-direction) property, when specified for table column boxes, is not inherited by\n cells in the column since columns are not the ancestors of the cells in\n the document tree. Thus, CSS cannot easily capture the \"dir\" attribute\n inheritance rules described in [[HTML401]](#biblio-html401), section 11.3.2.1. \n\n 2.2. Embeddings and Overrides: the [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) property[](#unicode-bidi)\n \n \n \n Name:\n **unicode-bidi**\n \n [Value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#value-defs)\n normal [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) embed | isolate | bidi-override | isolate-override | plaintext\n \n [Initial:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n normal\n \n Applies to:\n all elements, but see prose\n \n [Inherited:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no\n \n [Percentages:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#percentages)\n n/a\n \n [Computed value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#computed)\n specified value\n \n Canonical order:\n per grammar\n \n [Animation type:](https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable\n \n \nBecause HTML UAs can turn off CSS styling, we recommend HTML authors to use the HTML `dir` attribute, <bdo> element,\n and appropriate distinction of text-level vs. grouping-level HTML element types to ensure correct bidirectional layout in the absence of a style sheet. Authors should not use [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) in HTML documents. \n\n \nNormally (i.e. when [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) is [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal))\n an inline box is transparent to the unicode bidi algorithm;\n content is ordered as if the box’s boundaries were not there.\n Other values of the unicode-bidi property cause inline boxes\n to create scopes within the algorithm,\n and to override the intrinsic directionality of text. \n\n \nThe following informative table summarizes the box-internal and\n box-external effects of [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi): \n\n \n Effect of non-[normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal) values of [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) on inline boxes\n \n \n \n \n \n Outside\n \n strong\n neutral\n \n \n Inside\n scoped\n [embed](#valdef-unicode-bidi-embed)\n [isolate](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate)\n \n override\n [bidi-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-bidi-override)\n [isolate-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate-override)\n \n plaintext\n —\n [plaintext](#valdef-unicode-bidi-plaintext)\n \n \nValues for this property have the following (normative) meanings:\n\n \n **normal**\n The box does not open an additional level of embedding with\n respect to the bidirectional algorithm. For inline boxes,\n implicit reordering works across box boundaries.\n **embed**\n \n If the box is inline, this value creates a **directional embedding** by opening an additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.\n The direction of this embedding level is given by the [direction](#propdef-direction) property. Inside the box, reordering is done implicitly.\n \nThis value has no effect on boxes that are not inline. \n\n **isolate**\n \n On an inline box, this **bidi-isolates** its contents.\n This is similar to a directional embedding (and increases the embedding level accordingly)\n except that each sequence of inline-level boxes\n uninterrupted by any block boundary or [forced paragraph break](#forced-paragraph-break) is treated as an **isolated sequence**:\n \n\n the content within the sequence is ordered\n as if inside an independent paragraph\n with the base directionality specified by the box’s [direction](#propdef-direction) property.\n for the purpose of bidi resolution in its containing bidi paragraph,\n the sequence is treated as if it were a single Object Replacement Character (U+FFFC).\n \n\n In effect, neither is the content inside the box bidi-affected\n by the content surrounding the box,\n nor is the content surrounding the box bidi-affected by the\n content or specified directionality of the box.\n However, forced paragraph breaks within the box still create\n a corresponding break in the containing paragraph.\n \nThis value has no effect on boxes that are not inline. \n\n **bidi-override**\n This value puts the box’s immediate inline content in a **directional override**.\n For an inline, this means that the box acts like a [directional embedding](#directional-embedding) in the bidirectional algorithm,\n except that reordering within it is strictly in sequence according to the [direction](#propdef-direction) property; the implicit part of the bidirectional algorithm\n is ignored.\n For a block container, the override is applied\n to an anonymous inline box that surrounds all of its content.\n **isolate-override**\n This combines the [isolation](#bidi-isolate) behavior of [isolate](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate) with the [directional override](#directional-override) behavior of [bidi-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-bidi-override):\n to surrounding content, it is equivalent to isolate,\n but within the box content is ordered as if bidi-override were specified.\n It effectively nests a directional override inside an [isolated sequence](#isolated-sequence).\n **plaintext**\n \n \nThis value behaves as [isolate](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate) except that for the purposes of\n the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, the base directionality of each\n of the box’s [bidi paragraphs](#bidi-paragraph) (if a block container)\n or [isolated sequences](#isolated-sequence) (if an inline)\n is determined by following the heuristic in rules P2 and P3\n of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm\n (rather than by using the [direction](#propdef-direction) property of the box). \n\n \n \nFollowing Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm clause HL3 [[UAX9]](#biblio-uax9),\n values other than [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal) effectively insert the corresponding Unicode bidi control codes\n into the text stream at the start and end of the inline element\n before passing the paragraph to the Unicode bidirectional algorithm for reordering.\n (See [§ 2.4.2 CSS–Unicode Bidi Control Translation, Text Reordering](#bidi-control-codes).) \n\n \n Bidi control codes injected by [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) at the start/end of [display: inline](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-display) boxes\n \n \n \n \n \n [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) value\n [direction](#propdef-direction) value\n \n [ltr](#valdef-direction-ltr)\n [rtl](#valdef-direction-rtl)\n \n start\n end\n start\n end\n \n \n [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal)\n —\n —\n —\n —\n \n [embed](#valdef-unicode-bidi-embed)\n LRE (U+202A)\n PDF (U+202C)\n RLE (U+202B)\n PDF (U+202C)\n \n [isolate](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate)\n LRI (U+2066)\n PDI (U+2069)\n RLI (U+2067)\n PDI (U+2069)\n \n [bidi-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-bidi-override)*\n LRO (U+202D)\n PDF (U+202C)\n RLO (U+202E)\n PDF (U+202C)\n \n [isolate-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-isolate-override)*\n FSI,LRO (U+2068,U+202D)\n PDF,PDI (U+202C,U+2069)\n FSI,RLO (U+2068,U+202E)\n PDF,PDI (U+202C,U+2069)\n \n [plaintext](#valdef-unicode-bidi-plaintext)\n FSI (U+2068)\n PDI (U+2069)\n FSI (U+2068)\n PDI (U+2069)\n \n \n * The LRO/RLO+PDF pairs are also applied\n to the [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box) of a [block container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#block-container) if these values of [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) were specified on the block container. \n \n \nBecause the [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) property does not inherit,\n setting [bidi-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-bidi-override) or [plaintext](#valdef-unicode-bidi-plaintext) on a block box will\n not affect any descendant blocks. Therefore these values are best\n used on blocks and inlines that do not contain any block-level\n structures. \n\n \nNote that [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) does not affect the [direction](#propdef-direction) property even in the case of [plaintext](#valdef-unicode-bidi-plaintext), and thus does not affect direction-dependent layout calculations. \n\n \n Because the Unicode algorithm has a limit of 125 levels of embedding,\n care should be taken not to overuse [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) values other than [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal).\n In particular, a value of [inherit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/#valdef-all-inherit) should be used with extreme caution in deeply nested inline markup.\n However, for elements that are,\n in general, intended to be displayed as blocks, a setting of unicode-bidi: isolate is preferred to keep the element together\n in case the [display](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-display) is changed to [inline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#valdef-display-inline) (see example below). \n\n 2.3. Example of Bidirectional Text[](#bidi-example)\n \nThe following example shows an XML document with bidirectional\n text. It illustrates an important design principle: document language\n designers should take bidi into account both in the language proper\n (elements and attributes) and in any accompanying style sheets. The\n style sheets should be designed so that bidi rules are separate from\n other style rules, and such rules should not be overridden by other\n style sheets so that the document language’s bidi behavior is preserved.\n\n \n [](#example-16648d44)\n \nIn this example, lowercase letters stand for inherently left-to-right\n characters and uppercase letters represent inherently right-to-left\n characters. The text stream is shown below in logical backing store order.\n\n```\n<section dir=rtl>\n <para>HEBREW1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 HEBREW5</para>\n <para>HEBREW6 <emphasis>HEBREW7</emphasis> HEBREW8</para>\n</section>\n<section dir=ltr>\n <para>english9 english10 english11 HEBREW12 HEBREW13</para>\n <para>english14 english15 english16</para>\n <para>english17 <quote dir=rtl>HEBREW18 english19 HEBREW20</quote></para>\n</section>\n\n```\n\n \nSince this is arbitrary XML, the style sheet is responsible for\n setting the writing direction. This is the style sheet:\n\n```\n/* Rules for bidi */\n[dir=rtl] {direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: isolate; }\n[dir=ltr] {direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: isolate; }\n\n/* Rules for presentation */\nsection, para {display: block;}\nemphasis {font-weight: bold;}\nquote {font-style: italic;}\n\n```\n\n \nIf the line length is long,\n the formatting of this text might look like this:\n\n```\n 5WERBEH 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH 1WERBEH\n\n 8WERBEH 7WERBEH 6WERBEH\n\nenglish9 english10 english11 13WERBEH 12WERBEH\n\nenglish14 english15 english16\n\nenglish17 20WERBEH english19 18WERBEH\n\n```\n\n \nThe first `<section>` element is a block with a right-to-left base direction,\n the second `<section>` element is a block with a left-to-right base direction.\n The `<para>`s are blocks that inherit the base direction from their parents.\n Thus, the first two `<para>`s are read starting at the top right,\n the final three are read starting at the top left.\n\n \nThe `<emphasis>` element is inline-level,\n and since its value for [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) is [normal](#valdef-unicode-bidi-normal) (the initial value),\n it has no effect on the ordering of the text. \n\n \nThe `<quote>` element, on the other hand,\n creates an [isolated sequence](#isolated-sequence) with the given internal directionality.\n Note that this causes HEBREW18 to be to the right of english19. \n\n \nIf lines have to be broken, the same text might format like this:\n\n```\n 2WERBEH 1WERBEH\n -EH 4WERBEH english3\n 5WERB\n\n -EH 7WERBEH 6WERBEH\n 8WERB\n\nenglish9 english10 en-\nglish11 12WERBEH\n13WERBEH\n\nenglish14 english15\nenglish16\n\nenglish17 18WERBEH\n20WERBEH english19\n\n```\n\n \nNotice that because HEBREW18 must be read before english19,\n it is on the line above english19.\n Just breaking the long line from the earlier formatting would not have worked. \n\n \nNote also that the first syllable from english19 might have fit on the previous line,\n but hyphenation of left-to-right words in a right-to-left context, and vice versa,\n is usually suppressed to avoid having to display a hyphen in the middle of a line. \n\n \n 2.4. Applying the Bidirectional Reordering Algorithm[](#bidi-algo)\n \nUser agents that support bidirectional text must apply the Unicode\n bidirectional algorithm to every sequence of inline-level boxes uninterrupted\n by any block boundary or\n “[bidi type B](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Bidirectional_Character_Types)” **forced paragraph break**.\n This sequence forms the **paragraph** unit\n in the bidirectional algorithm. \n\n 2.4.1. Bidi Paragraph Embedding Levels[](#bidi-para-direction)\n \nIn CSS,\n the paragraph embedding level must be set\n (following [UAX9 clause HL1](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#HL1))\n according to the [direction](#propdef-direction) property of the paragraph’s containing block\n rather than by the heuristic given in steps [P2](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#P2) and [P3](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#P2) of the Unicode algorithm. \n\n \nThere is, however, one exception:\n when the computed [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) of the paragraph’s containing block is [plaintext](#valdef-unicode-bidi-plaintext),\n the Unicode heuristics in P2 and P3 are used as described in [[UAX9]](#biblio-uax9),\n without the HL1 override. \n\n 2.4.2. CSS–Unicode Bidi Control Translation, Text Reordering[](#bidi-control-codes)\n \nThe final order of characters within each [bidi paragraph](#bidi-paragraph) is the\n same as if the bidi control codes had been added as described for [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) (above),\n markup had been stripped, and the resulting character sequence had\n been passed to an implementation of the Unicode bidirectional\n algorithm for plain text that produced the same line-breaks as the\n styled text. \n\n \n Note that bidi control codes in the source text are still honored,\n and might not correspond to the document tree structure.\n This can split inlines or interfere with bidi start/end control pairing\n in interesting ways. \n\n 2.4.3. Bidi Treatment of Atomic Inlines[](#bidi-atomic-inlines)\n \nIn this process, [replaced elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#replaced-element) with [display: inline](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-display) are treated as neutral characters,\n unless their [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) property is either [embed](#valdef-unicode-bidi-embed) or [bidi-override](#valdef-unicode-bidi-bidi-override),\n in which case they are treated as strong characters\n in the [direction](#propdef-direction) specified for the element.\n (This is so that, in case the replaced element falls back to rendering inlined text content,\n its bidi effect on the surrounding text is consistent with its replaced rendering.) \n\n \nAll other atomic inline-level boxes are treated as neutral characters\n always.\n\n 2.4.4. Paragraph Breaks Within Embeddings and Isolates[](#bidi-embedding-breaks)\n \nIf an inline box is broken around a [bidi paragraph](#bidi-paragraph) boundary\n (e.g. if split by a block or [forced paragraph break](#forced-paragraph-break)),\n then the [HL3](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#HL3) bidi control codes assigned to the end of the box\n are also added before the interruption\n and the codes assigned to the start of the box are also added after it.\n (In other words, any embedding levels, isolates, or overrides started by the box\n are closed at the paragraph break and reopened on the other side of it.) \n\n \n [](#example-334883cc)\n \nFor example, where <BR/> is a [forced paragraph break](#forced-paragraph-break) the bidi ordering is identical between \n\n```\n<para>...<i1><i2>...<BR/>...</i2></i1>...</para>\n```\n\n \nand \n\n```\n<para>...<i1><i2>...</i2></i1><BR/><i1><i2>...</i2></i1>...</para>\n```\n\n \nfor all values of [unicode-bidi](#propdef-unicode-bidi) on inline elements <i1> and <i2>. \n\n \n \n Note that this behavior is applied by CSS for CSS-declared bidi controls\n applied to the box tree;\n it does not apply to Unicode’s bidi formatting controls,\n which are defined to terminate their effect at the end of the bidi paragraph. \n\n 2.4.5. Reordering-induced Box Fragmentation[](#bidi-box-model)\n \nSince bidi reordering can split apart and reorder text\n that is logically contiguous,\n bidirectional text can cause an [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box) containing such text\n to be split and its fragments reordered within a line. \n\n 2.4.5.1. Conditions of Reordering-induced Box Fragmentation[](#bidi-fragmentation)\n \n When bidi reordering would split apart an inline box\n due to intervening content,\n the inline box is considered to be broken into multiple [box fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment). [[CSS-BREAK-3]](#biblio-css-break-3) The box is considered to be thus [fragmented](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#fragment) if it would be divided by intervening content on an infinitely long line,\n even if line breaking happens to result in both box fragments being placed adjacent to each other on the line.\n In such cases, the nearest common ancestor of text in the two box fragments (which determines certain aspects of text formatting\n such as [tracking](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#tracking) and [justification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text/#text-justify-property) between the two box fragments, see [[CSS-TEXT-3]](#biblio-css-text-3))\n is considered to be the nearest common ancestor of the two box fragments,\n not the [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box) itself.\n However, an inline box is not considered to be broken\n into multiple box fragments due to bidi reordering\n if no intervening content would force it to split.\n (These rules maintain the integrity of an inline box where possible,\n while keeping bidi-induced fragmentation stable\n across variations in line-breaking.) \n\n \n [](#example-951ac452) In the following example, where lowercase letters represent LTR letters\n and uppercase letters represent RTL letters,\n bidi reordering causes the `<em>`’s [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box) to be divided into two [box fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment) separated by text outside the `<em>`.\n \nSource code (logical order):\n\n```\n<p>here is <em>some MIXED</em> TEXT.</p>\n```\n\n \nRendering (visual order) in a wide containing block, resulting in two inline box fragments separated by external content:\n\n```\nhere is some TXET DEXIM.\n```\n\n \nRendering (visual order) in a narrow containing block, resulting in two inline box fragments placed adjacent to each other:\n\n```\nhere is some DEXIM\nTXET.\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-f9f11e24) By contrast, in this example,\n where the mixed-direction phrase is kept together with an isolation,\n only one fragment is generated—the surrounding content will never split the `<em>`’s [inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box) even inside an infinitely-long containing block:\n \nSource code (logical order):\n\n```\n<p>here is <em dir=rtl>some MIXED</em> TEXT.</p>\n```\n\n \nRendering (visual order) in a wide containing block, resulting in one fragment:\n\n```\nhere is some DEXIM TXET.\n```\n\n \nRendering (visual order) in a narrow containing block, resulting in one fragment:\n\n```\nhere is some DEXIM\nTXET.\n\n```\n\n \n 2.4.5.2. Box Model of Reordering-induced Box Fragments[](#bidi-fragment-boxes)\n \nFor each line box, UAs must take the fragments of each inline box\n and assign the margins, borders and padding in visual order (not logical order).\n The [start](#start)-most fragment on the first line box in which the box appears\n has the start edge’s margin, border, and padding;\n and the end-most fragment on the last line box in which the box appears\n has the [end](#end) edge’s margin, border, and padding.\n For example, in the [horizontal-tb](#valdef-writing-mode-horizontal-tb) writing mode: \n\n \n\n When the parent’s [direction](#propdef-direction) property is [ltr](#valdef-direction-ltr),\n the left-most box fragment on the first line box in which the box appears\n has the left margin, left border and left padding,\n and the right-most box fragment on the last line box in which the box appears\n has the right padding, right border and right margin.\n When the parent’s [direction](#propdef-direction) property is [rtl](#valdef-direction-rtl),\n the right-most fragment of the first line box in which the box appears\n has the right padding, right border and right margin,\n and the left-most fragment of the last line box in which the box appears\n has the left margin, left border and left padding.\n \n\n \nAnalogous rules hold for vertical writing modes.\n\n \nThe [box-decoration-break](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#propdef-box-decoration-break) property can override this behavior\n to draw box decorations on both sides of each fragment.

Introduction to Vertical Writing[](#vertical-intro)\n \nThis subsection is non-normative.\n\n \nUnlike languages that use the Latin script which are primarily laid out\n horizontally, Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese can be laid out\n vertically. The Japanese example below shows the same text laid out\n horizontally and vertically. In the horizontal case, text is read\n from left to right, top to bottom. For the vertical case, the text is\n read top to bottom, right to left.\n Indentation from the left edge in the left-to-right horizontal case\n translates to indentation from the top edge in the top-to-bottom vertical\n case. \n\n \n \n\n \nComparison of vertical and horizontal Japanese: iBunko application (iOS)\n\n \n \nFor Chinese and Japanese lines are ordered either right\n to left or top to bottom, while for Mongolian and Manchu lines are\n ordered left to right.\n\n \nThe change from horizontal to vertical writing can affect not just the\n layout, but also the typesetting. For example, the position of a punctuation\n mark within its spacing box can change from the horizontal to the\n vertical case, and in some cases alternate glyphs are used. \n\n \nVertical text that includes Latin script text or text from other scripts\n normally displayed horizontally can display that text in a number of\n ways. For example, Latin words can be rotated sideways, or each letter\n can be oriented upright: \n\n \n \n\n \nExamples of Latin in vertical Japanese: Daijirin Viewer 1.4 (iOS) \n\n \n \nIn some special cases such as two-digit numbers in dates, text is fit\n compactly into a single vertical character box: \n\n \n \n\n \nMac Fan, December 2010, p.49\n\n \n \nLayouts often involve a mixture of vertical and horizontal elements: \n\n \n \n\n \nMixture of vertical and horizontal elements\n\n \n \nVertical text layouts also need to handle bidirectional text layout;\n clockwise-rotated Arabic, for example, is laid out bottom-to-top. \n\n 3.2.

This section discusses what baselines are, how to find them,\n and how they are used together with the vertical-align property to\n determine the alignment of inline-level content. \n\n 4.1. Introduction to Baselines[](#intro-baselines)\n \nThis section is non-normative.\n\n \nA **baseline[](#baseline)** is a line along the [inline axis](#inline-axis) of a line box\n along which individual glyphs of text are aligned. Baselines guide the\n design of glyphs in a font (for example, the bottom of most alphabetic\n glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline), and they guide\n the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting. \n\n \n \n\n \nAlphabetic text in two font sizes with the baseline and em-boxes\n\n \n \nDifferent writing systems prefer different baseline tables.\n\n \n \n\n \nPreferred baselines in various writing systems\n\n \n \nA well-constructed font contains a **baseline table[](#baseline-table)**, which\n indicates the position of one or more baselines within the font’s\n design coordinate space. (The design coordinate space is scaled with\n the font size.) \n\n \n \n\n \nIn a well-designed mixed-script font, the glyphs are\n positioned in the coordinate space to harmonize with one another\n when typeset together. The baseline table is then constructed to\n match the shape of the glyphs, each baseline positioned to match\n the glyphs from its preferred scripts.\n\n \n \nThe baseline table is a property of the font, and the positions\n of the various baselines apply to all glyphs in the font. \n\n \nDifferent baseline tables can be provided for alignment in\n horizontal and vertical text. UAs should use the vertical\n tables in vertical [typographic modes](#typographic-mode) and the horizontal tables\n otherwise. \n\n 4.2. Text Baselines[](#text-baselines)\n \nIn this specification, only the following baselines are considered: \n\n \n alphabetic\n The **alphabetic baseline**, which typically aligns with the\n bottom of uppercase Latin glyphs.\n central\n The **central baseline**, which typically crosses the center\n of the em box. If the font is missing this baseline,\n it is assumed to be halfway between the ascender ([over](#over))\n and descender ([under](#under)) edges of the em box.\n \n \nIn vertical [typographic mode](#typographic-mode), the [central baseline](#central-baseline) is used as the\n dominant baseline when [text-orientation](#propdef-text-orientation) is [mixed](#valdef-text-orientation-mixed) or [upright](#valdef-text-orientation-upright).\n Otherwise the [alphabetic baseline](#alphabetic-baseline) is used. \n\n \nA future CSS module will deal with baselines in more\n detail and allow the choice of other dominant baselines and alignment\n options.\n\n 4.3. Atomic Inline Baselines[](#replaced-baselines)\n \nIf an [atomic\n inline](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#inline-boxes) (such as an inline-block, inline-table, or replaced inline element)\n does not have a baseline,\n then the UA synthesizes a baseline table thus: \n\n \n alphabetic\n The alphabetic baseline is assumed to be at the [under](#under) margin edge.\n central\n The central baseline is assumed to be halfway between the [under](#under) and [over](#over) margin edges of the box.\n \n \nThe [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) property in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) defines the baseline of\n inline-table and inline-block boxes with some exceptions. \n\n 4.4. Baseline Alignment[](#baseline-alignment)\n \nThe **dominant baseline[](#dominant-baseline)** (which [can change](#text-baselines) based on the [typographic mode](#typographic-mode))\n is used in CSS for alignment in two cases: \n\n \n\n Aligning glyphs from different fonts within the same inline box. The glyphs are aligned by matching up the positions of the dominant\n baseline in their corresponding fonts.\n \n Aligning a child inline-level box within its parent. For the [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) value of baseline, child is aligned to\n the parent by matching the parent’s dominant baseline to the same\n baseline in the child. (E.g. if the parent’s dominant baseline is\n alphabetic, then the child’s alphabetic baseline is matched to the\n parent’s alphabetic baseline, even if the child’s dominant baseline\n is something else.)\n For values of sub, super, [<length>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#length-value), and [<percentage>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#percentage-value), the baselines are aligned as for baseline,\n but the child is shifted according to the offset given by its vertical-align value.\n \n [](#example-edb77cae)\n \nGiven following sample markup: \n\n```\n<p><span class=\"outer\">Ap <span class=\"inner\">ji</span></span></p>\n```\n\n \nAnd the following style rule: \n\n```\nspan.inner { font-size: .75em; }\n```\n\n \nThe baseline tables of the parent (`.outer`) and the child\n (`.inner`) will not match up due to the font size difference.\n Since the dominant baseline is the alphabetic baseline, the child box\n is aligned to its parent by matching up their alphabetic baselines. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n [](#example-3b107e11)\n \nIf we assign [vertical-align: super](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) to the `.inner` element from the example above, the same rules are used to align\n the `.inner` child to its parent; the only difference\n is in addition to the baseline alignment, the child is shifted to\n the superscript position. \n\n```\nspan.inner { vertical-align: super; font-size: .75em; }\n```",

Mixed Vertical Orientations[](#vertical-orientations)\n \n [[UTR50]](#biblio-utr50) defines the `Vertical_Orientation` property\n for the default glyph orientation of mixed-orientation vertical text.\n When [text-orientation](#propdef-text-orientation) is [mixed](#valdef-text-orientation-mixed),\n the UA must determine the orientation of each [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) by its `Vertical_Orientation` property: [typeseting it upright](#typeset-upright) if its orientation property is `U`, `Tu`, or `Tr`;\n or [typesetting it sideways](#typeset-sideways) (90° clockwise from horizontal)\n if its orientation property is `R`. \n\n \n Note that UTR50 does not handle scripts that rotate -90° in vertical contexts,\n so they will not be typeset correctly with [mixed](#valdef-text-orientation-mixed) orientation.\n Use [sideways-lr](#valdef-writing-mode-sideways-lr) for such scripts. \n\n \n The OpenType vrt2 feature, which is intended for mixed-orientation typesetting,\n is not used by CSS.\n It delegates the responsibility for orienting glyphs to the font designer.\n CSS instead dictates the orientation through [[UTR50]](#biblio-utr50) and orients glyphs by typesetting them sideways or upright as appropriate. \n\n 5.1.3.

Layout is analogous\n in writing modes other than horizontal-tb; however directional\n and dimensional terms in CSS2.1 must be abstracted and remapped\n appropriately. \n\n \nThis section defines abstract directional and dimensional terms and\n their mappings in order to define box layout for other writing modes,\n and to provide terminology for future specs to define their layout\n concepts abstractly. (The next section explains how to apply them to\n CSS2.1 layout calculations and how to handle [orthogonal flows](#orthogonal-flows).)\n Although they derive from the behavior of text, these abstract\n mappings exist even for boxes that do not contain any line boxes:\n they are calculated directly from the values of the [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode) and [direction](#propdef-direction) properties. \n\n \nThere are three sets of directional terms in CSS: \n\n \n **physical[](#physical)**\n Interpreted relative to the page, independent of writing mode.\n The **physical directions[](#physical-direction)** are **left[](#physical-left)**, **right[](#physical-right)**, **top[](#physical-top)**, and **bottom[](#physical-bottom)**.\n **[flow-relative](#logical-directions)[](#flow-relative)**\n Interpreted relative to the flow of content.\n The flow-relative directions are [start](#start) and [end](#end),\n or [block-start](#block-start), [block-end](#block-end), [inline-start](#inline-start), and [inline-end](#inline-end) if the dimension is also ambiguous.\n **[line-relative](#line-directions)[](#line-relative)**\n Interpreted relative to the orientation of the line box.\n The line-relative directions are [line-left](#line-left), [line-right](#line-right), [line-over](#line-over), and [line-under](#line-under).\n \n \nThe **physical dimensions[](#physical-dimensions)** are **width[](#width)** and **height[](#height)**,\n which correspond to measurements along the **x-axis** (**horizontal dimension**) and **y-axis** (**vertical dimension**),\n respectively.

Line-relative Directions[](#line-directions)\n \nThe **line orientation** determines which side of a line\n box is the logical “top” (ascender side).\n It is given by the [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode) property.\n Usually the line-relative “top”\n corresponds to the [block-start](#block-start) side, but this is not always the case:\n in Mongolian typesetting (and thus by default in [vertical-lr](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-lr) writing\n modes), the line-relative “top” corresponds to the [block-end](#block-end) side.\n Hence the need for distinct terminology. \n\n \n \n \nA primarily Mongolian document, such as the one above, is written in\n vertical lines stacking left to right, but lays its Latin text with\n the tops of the glyphs towards the right. This makes the text run in\n the same inline direction as Mongolian (top-to-bottom) and face the\n same direction it does in other East Asian layouts (which have vertical\n lines stacking right to left), but the glyphs' tops are facing the\n bottom of the line stack rather than the top, which in an English\n paragraph would be upside-down. (See this [Diagram of Mongolian\n Text Layout](diagrams/text-flow-vectors-lr-reverse.svg).) \n\n \n \nIn addition to a line-relative “top” and “bottom” to map things like\n 'vertical-align: top', CSS also needs to refer to a line-relative\n “left” and “right” in order to map things like [text-align: left](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-align).\n Thus there are four **line-relative directions**, which are\n defined relative to the [line orientation](#line-orientation) as follows: \n\n \n **over** or **line-over**\n Nominally the side that corresponds to the ascender side or “top”\n side of a line box. (The side overlines are typically drawn on.)\n **under** or **line-under**\n Opposite of [over](#over): the line-relative “bottom” or descender side.\n (The side underlines are typically drawn on.)\n **line-left**\n The line-relative \"left\" side of a line box,\n which is nominally the side from which LTR text would start.\n **line-right**\n The line-relative \"right\" side of a line box,\n which is nominally the side from which RTL text would start.

Principles of Layout in Vertical Writing Modes[](#vertical-layout)\n \nCSS box layout in vertical writing modes is analogous to layout in\n the horizontal writing modes, following the principles outlined below: \n\n \nLayout calculation rules (such as those in CSS2.1, Section 10.3)\n that apply to the horizontal dimension in horizontal writing modes\n instead apply to the vertical dimension in vertical writing modes.\n Likewise, layout calculation rules (such as those in CSS2.1, Section 10.6)\n that apply to the vertical dimension in horizontal writing modes\n instead apply to the horizontal dimension in vertical writing modes.\n Thus: \n\n \n\n \n \nLayout rules that refer to the width use the height instead,\n and vice versa. \n\n \n \nLayout rules that refer to the *-left and *-right box properties (border, margin, padding, positioning offsets)\n use *-top and *-bottom instead, and vice versa,\n mapping the horizontal writing-mode rules of CSS2.1\n into vertical writing-mode rules using the [flow-relative directions](#flow-relative-direction).\n The side of the box these properties apply to doesn’t change:\n only which values are inputs to which layout calculations changes.\n The [margin-left](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-left) property still affects the lefthand margin, for example;\n however in a [vertical-rl](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl) writing mode it takes part in margin collapsing\n in place of [margin-bottom](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-bottom). \n\n \n \nLayout rules that depend on the [direction](#propdef-direction) property to choose between\n left and right (e.g. overflow, overconstraint resolution, the initial\n value for [text-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-align), table column ordering)\n are abstracted to the [start](#start) and [end](#end) sides\n and applied appropriately.\n\n \n\n \n [](#example-63009bd2)\n \nFor example, in vertical writing modes,\n table rows are vertical and table columns are horizontal.\n In a [vertical-rl](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl) [mixed](#valdef-text-orientation-mixed) [rtl](#valdef-direction-rtl) table,\n the first column would be on the bottom (the [inline-start](#inline-start) side),\n and the first row on the right (the [block-start](#block-start) side).\n The table’s [margin-right](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-right) and [margin-left](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-left) would collapse\n with margins before (on the right) and after (on the left) the table, respectively,\n and if the table had auto values for [margin-top](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-top) and [margin-bottom](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/#propdef-margin-bottom) it would be centered vertically within its block flow. \n\n \n \n[ ](diagrams/vertical-table.svg) \n\n \nTable in [vertical-rl](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl) RTL writing mode\n\n \n \n \nFor features such as text alignment, floating, and list marker positioning,\n that primarily reference the left or right sides of the line box or\n its longitudinal parallels and therefore have no top or bottom equivalent,\n the [line-left](#line-left) and [line-right](#line-right) sides\n are used as the reference for the left and right sides respectively. \n\n \nLikewise for features such as underlining, overlining, and baseline alignment\n (the unfortunately-named [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align)), that primarily reference the\n top or bottom sides of the linebox or its transversal parallels and\n therefore have no left or right equivalent, the [line-over](#line-over) and [line-under](#line-under) sides are used as the reference for the\n top and bottom sides respectively. \n\n \nThe details of these mappings are provided below. \n\n 7.2. Dimensional Mapping[](#dimension-mapping)\n \nCertain properties behave logically as follows: \n\n \n\n The first and second values of the [border-spacing](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#propdef-border-spacing) property\n represent spacing between columns and rows respectively, not\n necessarily the horizontal and vertical spacing respectively. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n The [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-line-height) property always refers to the logical\n height. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n \n\n \nThe height properties ([height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-height), [min-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-min-height), and [max-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-max-height))\n refer to the physical height, and the width properties ([width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-width), [min-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-min-width), and [max-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-max-width)) refer to the physical width. However,\n the rules used to calculate box dimensions and positions are logical. \n\n \nFor example, the calculation rules in [CSS2.1 Section 10.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins) are used for the inline dimension measurements:\n they apply to the [inline size](#inline-size) (which could be either the physical width or physical height)\n and to the [inline-start](#inline-start) and [inline-end](#inline-end) margins, padding, and border.\n Likewise the calculation rules in [CSS2.1 Section 10.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins) are used in the block dimension:\n they apply to the [block size](#block-size) and to the [block-start](#block-start) and [block-end](#block-end) margins, padding, and border. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) \n\n \nAs a corollary, percentages on the margin and padding properties,\n which are always calculated with respect to the containing block\n width in CSS2.1, are calculated with respect to the [inline size](#inline-size) of the containing block in CSS3. \n\n 7.3. Orthogonal Flows[](#orthogonal-flows)\n We appreciate feedback in general,\n but we are particularly interested in feedback\n on this particularly complicated section. \n \nWhen a box has a different [writing-mode](#propdef-writing-mode) from its\n containing block two cases are possible: \n\n \n\n The two writing modes are parallel to each other. (For example, [vertical-rl](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl) and [vertical-lr](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-lr)).\n The two writing modes are perpendicular to each other. (For\n example, [horizontal-tb](#valdef-writing-mode-horizontal-tb) and [vertical-rl](#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl)).\n \n\n \n When a box has a writing mode that is perpendicular to its containing block\n it is said to be in, or establish, an **orthogonal flow**. \n\n \n To handle this case, CSS layout calculations are divided into\n two phases: sizing a box, and positioning the box within its flow. \n\n \n\n In the sizing phase—calculating the width and height of the\n box—the dimensions of the box and the containing block\n are mapped to the [inline size](#inline-size) and [block size](#block-size) and calculations are performed\n accordingly using the writing mode of\n the box establishing the [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow).\n In the positioning phase—calculating the positioning offsets,\n margins, borders, and padding—the dimensions of the box and\n its containing block are mapped to the [inline size](#inline-size) and [block size](#block-size) and calculations are performed according to the writing mode of the containing block of the box establishing the [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow).\n \n\n \nSince auto margins are resolved consistent with the containing\n block’s writing mode, a box establishing an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow) can,\n once sized, be aligned or centered within its containing block just\n like other block-level boxes by using auto margins. \n\n \n [](#example-d9cb469c)\n \n \n \n\n \nAn example of orthogonal flow\n\n \n \n For example, if a vertical block is placed inside a horizontal block,\n then when calculating the physical height (which is the [inline size](#inline-size))\n of the child block the physical height of the parent block is used\n as the child’s containing block inline size,\n even though the physical height is the [block size](#block-size), not the inline size,\n of the parent block. \n\n \n On the other hand,\n because the containing block is in a horizontal writing mode,\n the vertical margins on the child participate in margin-collapsing,\n even though they are in the [inline-axis](#inline-axis) of the child,\n and horizontal auto margins will expand to fill the containing block,\n even though they are in the [block-axis](#block-axis) of the child. \n\n \n \n [](#orthogonal-shrink-to-fit) Note that this section requires that\n when a child box auto-sized in its block axis\n establishes an orthogonal flow,\n the used block size of the child\n is calculated to fit its content;\n and this resulting content-based size\n is used as input to the [inline-axis](#inline-axis) [min-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-content) and [max-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content) of the parent.\n \n This means that when applying shrink-to-fit formula to a box\n such as an inline-block, float, or table-cell,\n if its child establishes an orthogonal flow,\n the calculation dependency must be changed so that\n the sizing phase of the child runs first and\n its used [block size](#block-size) becomes an input to the [inline-size](#inline-size) shrink-to-fit formula of the parent. \n\n \n 7.3.1. Available Space in Orthogonal Flows[](#orthogonal-auto)\n \nIt is common in CSS for a containing block to have a definite [inline size](#inline-size),\n but not a definite [block size](#block-size).\n This typically happens in CSS2.1\n when a containing block has an [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto) height,\n for example: its width is given by the calculations in [10.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth),\n but its block size depends on its contents.\n In such cases the [available inline space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available) is defined\n as the inline size of the containing block;\n but the available block space,\n which would otherwise be the block size of the containing block,\n is infinite. \n\n \nPutting a box in an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow) can result in the opposite:\n for the box’s [available block space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available) to be definite,\n but its available inline space to be indefinite.\n In such cases a percentage of the containing block’s [inline size](#inline-size) cannot be defined,\n and [inline axis](#inline-axis) computations cannot be resolved.\n In these cases,\n an additional constraint is used as a [fallback](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#fallback) in place of the available inline space for calculations that require a definite available inline space—the smallest of \n\n \n\n the size represented by\n the containing block’s inner [max size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-width) (if that is fixed)\n floored by its inner [min size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-width) (if that is fixed)\n the nearest ancestor [scrollport](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollport)’s inner size if that is fixed,\n else / capped by its inner [max size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-width) if that is fixed,\n floored by its inner [min size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-width) if that is fixed\n the initial containing block’s size\n \n\n \nSee [[CSS3-SIZING]](#biblio-css3-sizing) for further details on CSS sizing terminology and concepts. \n\n 7.3.2. Auto-sizing Block Containers in Orthogonal Flows[](#auto-multicol)\n \n If a box establishing an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow) is\n either a block container or a multi-column container,\n for the case where the box’s [inline size](#inline-size) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto): \n\n \n\n \n Calculate the used [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width):\n \n\n \n If [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count) and [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width) are both [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#valdef-column-width-auto),\n use the shrink-to-fit formula min(max-content, max(min-content, constraint)),\n where:\n \n min-content\n the [min-content inline size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-content-inline-size) of the box\n max-content\n the [max-content inline size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content-inline-size) of the box\n constraint\n \n the [inline-axis](#inline-axis) size\n that would [stretch fit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#stretch-fit) into to the smallest of\n \n\n the [available space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available):\n the containing block’s size if that is fixed,\n else the size represented by\n the containing block’s inner [max size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-width) (if that is fixed)\n floored by its inner [min size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-width) (if that is fixed)\n the nearest ancestor [scrollport](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollport)’s inner size if that is fixed,\n else / capped by its inner [max size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-width) if that is fixed,\n floored by its inner [min size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-width) if that is fixed\n the initial containing block’s size\n \n\n \n \n \n Note that this requirement automatically triggers multi-column flow on all block containers. This is so that overflowing content, instead of continuing off the side of the containing block,\n is wrapped into columns in the flow direction of the containing block,\n thus avoiding T-shaped documents.\n Authors can control the [inline size](#inline-size) of these columns by setting [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width),\n or disable this behavior by setting the inline size property\n to a non-[auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto) value such as [max-content](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-max-content). \n \n If [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count) is not [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#valdef-column-count-auto) and [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width) is auto,\n calculate the used column-width with the same formula,\n except replace constraint with constraint − (column-count − 1) × [column-gap](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-gap).\n If [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count) and [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width) are both non-[auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#valdef-column-count-auto),\n the used column-width is the computed column-width.\n (This is not recommended as it can cause overflow;\n instead it is better to set the column-width and a max-block-size.)\n \n\n \n Calculate the used column length: If the computed [block size](#block-size) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto) and the specified value of at least one of [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count) and [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width) was [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#valdef-column-width-auto),\n use the box’s block size (if that is [definite](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#definite)),\n else the [stretch-fit block size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#stretch-fit-block-size) of the box (if that is definite),\n else the box’s [max-content block size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content-block-size).\n Otherwise follow the normal rules for sizing a multi-column container.\n \n[](#issue-fae7187e) Should we factor in the box’s [min-content block size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#min-content-block-size) in this formula,\n so that e.g. a large image will not overflow the box,\n but cause the box to overflow the containing block? \n\n Calculate the used [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count): If the computed [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#valdef-column-count-auto), then\n the used column-count follows from filling the resulting multi-column layout\n with the box’s content.\n \n\n \n The used [inline size](#inline-size) of the resulting multi-column container is then calculated: \n\n \n\n If the content neither line-wraps nor fragments within the multi-column container,\n then the used [inline size](#inline-size) is the [max-content inline size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content-inline-size) of the box’s contents.\n This criteria gives the shrink-to-fit behavior for short orthogonal flow contents\n without making a large blank space.\n Otherwise it is calculated from the used [column-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-width), [column-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-count), and [column-gap](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#propdef-column-gap).\n \n\n \n The used [block size](#block-size) of the box is either the used column length\n (if multiple columns were used)\n or the [max-content block size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content-block-size) of the content\n (if only one column was used).\n If the UA does not support CSS Multi-column Layout [[CSS3COL]](#biblio-css3col),\n the UA may instead calculate the box’s block size assuming infinite [available block space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available),\n thus laying out its contents into a single column.\n (Note that this can, however, result in content that is clipped\n or otherwise inaccessible if it overflows its containing block.) \n\n \nThe automatic triggering of multi-column flow is at-risk and may be dropped during CR. \n\n 7.3.3. Auto-sizing Other Orthogonal Flow Roots[](#orthogonal-layout)\n \nIn order to limit the length of lines,\n block containers have special auto-sizing behavior (defined [above](#auto-multicol))\n when their [available inline space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available) is infinite\n (which typically occurs when they establish an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow)). \n\n \nOther layout models simply lay out into the infinite [available inline space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available) at their [max-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content).\n However, they pass through the infinite available inline space to block containers they contain,\n possibly triggering that special auto-sizing behavior on those block containers\n even though they do not themselves establish an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow). \n\n \n [](#example-e2cd91dc)\n \nFor example,\n a table or [flex container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-container) establishing an [orthogonal flow](#establish-an-orthogonal-flow) is laid out into its given [available space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#available).\n If its available inline space is infinite,\n this effectively lays the box out at its [max-content size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#max-content).\n However, any of its table cells or [flex items](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-item) that are [block containers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#block-container) are laid out assuming infinite available inline space and so behave accordingly. \n\n \n 7.3.4. Fragmenting Orthogonal Flows[](#orthogonal-pagination)\n \nThis section is informative.\n\n \nWith regards to fragmentation, the rules in CSS2.1 still hold in\n vertical writing modes and orthogonal flows: break opportunities\n do not occur inside line boxes, only between them.\n UAs that support [[CSS3COL]](#biblio-css3col) may break in the (potentially zero-width)\n gap between columns, however. \n\n \nNote that if content spills outside the pagination stream\n established by the root element, the UA is not required to print\n such content. Authors wishing to mix writing modes with long streams\n of text are thus encouraged to use CSS columns to keep all content\n flowing in the document’s pagination direction. \n\n \n \nIn other words, if your document would require two scrollbars on\n the screen it probably won’t all print. Fix your layout, e.g. by\n using [columns](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/) so\n that it all scrolls (and therefore paginates) in one direction if\n you want to make sure it’ll all print. T-shaped documents tend not\n to print well. \n\n \n 7.4. Flow-Relative Mappings[](#logical-direction-layout)\n \nFlow-relative directions are calculated with respect to\n the writing mode of the containing block of the\n box and used to abstract layout rules related to the\n box properties (margins, borders, padding) and any properties\n related to positioning the box within its containing block\n ([float](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-float), [clear](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-clear), [top](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-top), [bottom](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-bottom), [left](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-left), [right](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-right), [caption-side](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#propdef-caption-side)).\n For inline-level boxes, the writing mode of the parent\n box is used instead.\n (The left/right/top/bottom-named properties and values themselves are still mapped physically;\n with a special exception made for caption-side,\n whose top/top-outside and bottom/bottom-outside values\n are associated to the [block-start](#block-start) and [block-end](#block-end) sides of the table, respectively.) \n\n \nFor example, the margin that is dropped when a box’s inline\n dimension is [over-constrained](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth) is the end margin as determined by the writing mode of the\n containing block. \n\n \nThe [margin\n collapsing rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins) apply exactly with the [block-start](#block-start) margin substituted for the top margin and the [block-end](#block-end) margin substituted for the bottom margin.\n Similarly the [block-start](#block-start) padding and border are substituted\n for the top padding and border, and the [block-end](#block-end) padding and\n border substituted for the bottom padding and border.\n Note this means only block-start and block-end margins ever collapse. \n\n \nFlow-relative directions are calculated with respect to\n the writing mode of the box and used to abstract layout\n related to the box’s contents: \n\n \n\n The initial value of the [text-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-align) property\n aligns to the [start](#start) edge of the line box.\n The [text-indent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-indent) property indents from the [start](#start) edge of the line box.\n For tables, the ordering of columns begins on the [inline-start](#inline-start) side of the table, and the ordering of rows begins on the [block-start](#block-start) side of the table.\n \n\n 7.5. Line-Relative Mappings[](#line-mappings)\n \nThe [line-relative directions](#line-relative-direction) are [over](#over), [under](#under), [line-left](#line-left), and [line-right](#line-right).\n In an LTR [horizontal-tb](#valdef-writing-mode-horizontal-tb) writing mode,\n they correspond to the\n top, bottom, left, and right directions, respectively. \n\n \nThe [line-right](#line-right) and [line-left](#line-left) directions are calculated\n with respect to the writing mode of the box and used\n to interpret the left and right values of the\n following properties: \n\n \n\n the [text-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-align) property [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n \n\n \nThe [line-right](#line-right) and [line-left](#line-left) directions are calculated\n with respect to the writing mode of the containing\n block of the box and used to interpret the left and right values of the following properties: \n\n \n\n the [float](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-float) property [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n the [clear](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-clear) property [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n the [caption-side](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#propdef-caption-side) property [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n \n\n \nThe [over](#over) and [under](#under) directions are calculated with respect to\n the writing mode of the box and used to define the\n interpretation of the \"top\" (over) and \"bottom\" (under)\n sides of the line box as follows: \n\n \n\n For the [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align) property,\n the \"top\" of the line box is its [over](#over) edge;\n the \"bottom\" of the line box is its under edge.\n Positive length and percentage values\n shift the baseline towards the [line-over](#line-over) edge. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n For the [text-decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/#propdef-text-decoration) property,\n the underline is drawn on the [under](#under) side of the text;\n the overline is drawn on the [over](#over) side of the text. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) Note that the CSS Text Decoration Module defines\n this in more detail and provides additional controls for\n controlling the position of underlines and overlines.

Horizontal-in-Vertical Composition: the [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) property[](#text-combine-upright)\n \n \n \n Name:\n **text-combine-upright**\n \n [Value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#value-defs)\n none [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) all | [ digits <integer>[?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt) ]\n \n [Initial:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n none\n \n Applies to:\n non-replaced inline elements\n \n [Inherited:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n yes\n \n [Percentages:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#percentages)\n n/a\n \n [Computed value:](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade/#computed)\n specified keyword, plus integer if digits\n \n Canonical order:\n n/a\n \n [Animation type:](https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable\n \n \nThis property specifies the combination of multiple [typographic character units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) into the space of a single typographic character unit.\n If the combined text is wider than 1em, the UA must fit the contents within 1em, see below.\n The resulting composition is treated as a single upright glyph for the purposes of layout and decoration.\n This property only has an effect in vertical writing modes. Values have the following meanings: \n\n \n **none**\n No special processing.\n **all**\n Attempt to typeset horizontally\n all consecutive [typographic character units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) within the box\n such that they take up the space of a single typographic character unit within the vertical line box.\n **digits [<integer>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#integer-value)?[](#valdef-text-combine-upright-digits-integer)**\n Attempt to typeset horizontally\n each maximal sequence of consecutive ASCII digits (U+0030–U+0039)\n that has as many or fewer digits than the specified integer\n such that it takes up the space of a single [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) within the vertical line box.\n If the integer is omitted, it computes to 2.\n Integers outside the range 2-4 are invalid.\n \n \n [](#example-57d55bfa)\n \nIn East Asian documents, the text-combine-upright effect is often\n used to display Latin-based strings such as components of a date or\n letters of an initialism, always in a horizontal writing mode\n regardless of the writing mode of the line:\n\n \n \n \n\n \nExample of horizontal-in-vertical tate-chu-yoko\n\n \n \nThe figure is the result of the rules\n\n```\ndate { text-combine-upright: digits 2; }\n\n```\n\n \nand the following markup:\n\n```\n<date>平成20年4月16日に</date>\n\n```\n\n \nIn Japanese, this effect is known as tate-chu-yoko. \n\n \n \n [](#example-feb64026)\n \nThe following example shows that applying [text-combine-upright: digits 2](#propdef-text-combine-upright) to an entire document, rather than to a segment with a known type of\n numeric content, can have unintended consequences: \n\n```\n<p>あれは10,000円ですよ！</p>\n```\n\n \n \n \n\n \nExample of mis-applied tate-chu-yoko\n\n \n \n 9.1.1. Text Run Rules[](#text-combine-runs)\n \nTo avoid complexity in the rendering and layout, [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) can only combine plain text:\n consecutive [typographic character units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) that are not interrupted by a box boundary. \n\n \nHowever, because the property inherits,\n the UA must ensure that the contents of the box effecting the combination\n are not part of an otherwise-combinable sequence\n that happens to begin or end outside the box;\n if so, then the text is laid out normally,\n as if [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) were [none](#valdef-text-combine-upright-none).\n To avoid combining only part of a sequence:\n if the boundary of a potentially-combinable run\n is due only to one or more inline box boundaries,\n the UA must inspect any characters that appear\n immediately before and immediately after the run,\n and if these characters would, without the intervening box,\n form a sequence that would (if it were not too long) combine,\n then the candidate run does not combine. \n\n \nThe above paragraph is at-risk. Comments from implementors are welcome.\n\n \n [](#example-73e9bf5b)\n \nFor example, given the rule \n\n```\ntcy { text-combine-upright: digits 4; }\n```\n\n \nif the following markup were given: \n\n```\n<tcy>12<span>34</span></tcy>\n```\n\n \nno text would combine: the 12 and 34 both share an ancestor with the same [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) value,\n and therefore are considered part of a sequence of four combinable digits interrupted by a box boundary.\n However in these cases: \n\n```\n12<tcy><span>34</span></tcy>12<tcy><span></span>34</tcy>\n12<tcy>34<span></span></tcy>\n```\n\n \nThe 34 would combine, because the 12 immediately previous does not share with the 34 an ancestor with a common [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright),\n and therefore the 34 is considered to be the entirety of a sequence of two combinable digits. \n\n \nIf we used the rule \n\n```\ntcy { text-combine-upright: all; }\n```\n\n \nthe same results would occur:\n the first case not combining because 1234 forms a sequence of four combinable characters interrupted by a box boundary,\n and the second combining 34 because it forms the entirety of a sequence of two combinable characters.\n\n \n \n Note that the value of [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) ([all](#valdef-text-combine-upright-all) or digits)\n only affects which types of [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) can be combined\n and what is the maximum length of a combinable sequence.\n It does not otherwise change behavior. \n\n 9.1.2. Layout Rules[](#text-combine-layout)\n \nWhen combining text as for [text-combine-upright: all](#propdef-text-combine-upright),\n the glyphs of the combined text are [bidi-isolated](#bidi-isolate) and composed horizontally\n (ignoring [letter-spacing](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-letter-spacing) and any forced line breaks,\n but using the specified font settings),\n similar to the contents of an [inline-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#valdef-display-inline-block) box\n with a [horizontal writing mode](#horizontal-writing-mode) and a [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-line-height) of 1em.\n Any [document white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#white-space) included at the start/end of the combined text is [processed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#white-space-processing) [[CSS-TEXT-3]](#biblio-css-text-3) as at the start/end of such an inline block.\n The effective size of the composition is assumed to be 1em square;\n anything outside the square is not measured for layout purposes.\n The UA should center the glyphs horizontally and vertically within the measured 1em square. \n\n \nThe baseline of the resulting composition must be chosen such that the square is centered\n between the text-over and text-under baselines of its parent inline box prior to any baseline alignment shift ([vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-vertical-align)).\n For bidi reordering, the composition is treated the same as a [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) with [text-orientation: upright](#propdef-text-orientation).\n For line breaking before and after the composition, it is treated as a regular inline with its actual contents.\n For other text layout purposes,\n e.g. emphasis marks, text-decoration, spacing,\n etc. the resulting composition is treated as a single glyph\n representing the Object Replacement Character U+FFFC. \n\n 9.1.3. Compression Rules[](#text-combine-compression)\n \nThe UA must ensure that the combined advance width of the composition\n fits within 1em by compressing the combined text if necessary.\n (This does not necessarily mean that the glyphs will fit within 1em,\n as some glyphs are designed to draw outside their geometric boundaries.)\n OpenType implementations must use width-specific variants\n (OpenType features `hwid`/`twid`/`qwid`;\n other glyph-width features such as `fwid` or `pwid` are not included)\n to compress text\n in cases where those variants are available for all [typographic character units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) in the composition.\n Otherwise, the UA may use any means to compress the text,\n including substituting half-width, third-width, and/or quarter-width glyphs provided by the font,\n using other font features designed to compress text horizontally,\n scaling the text geometrically,\n or any combination thereof. \n\n \n [](#example-da304b32)\n \nFor example, a simple OpenType-based implementation might compress the text as follows: \n\n \n\n Enable 1/n-width glyphs for combined text of n [typographic character units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit) (i.e. use OpenType `hwid` for 2 typographic character units, `twid` for 3 typographic character units, etc.)\n if the number of typographic character units > 1.\n Note that the number of typographic character units ≠ number of Unicode codepoints!\n If the result is wider than 1em, horizontally scale the result to 1em.\n \n\n \nA different implementation that utilizes OpenType layout features\n might compose the text first with normal glyphs to see if that fits,\n then substitute in half-width or third-width forms as available and necessary,\n possibly adjusting its approach or combining it with scaling operations\n depending on the available glyph substitutions. \n\n \n \nIn some fonts, the ideographic glyphs are given a compressed design\n such that they are 1em wide but shorter than 1em tall.\n To accommodate such fonts, the UA may vertically scale the composition\n to match the advance height of 水 U+6C34\n as rendered according to the specified font settings.\n In such a case the resulting composition assumes\n the advance height of 水 U+6C34 rather than 1em. \n\n 9.1.3.1. Full-width Characters[](#text-combine-fullwidth)\n \nIn order to preserve typographic color when compressing the text to 1em,\n when the combined text consists of more than one [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit),\n then any full-width typographic character units should first be converted to their non-full-width equivalents\n by reversing the algorithm defined for [text-transform: full-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-transform) in [[CSS-TEXT-3]](#biblio-css-text-3) before applying other compression techniques. \n\n \n [](#example-b52a6513)\n \nFor example, an author might apply both [text-transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-transform) and [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) to a date set in vertical text. \n\n```\ndate { text-combine-upright: digits 2; text-transform: full-width; }\n```\n\n \nSuppose this style rule is applied to a date such as. \n\n```\n<date>2010年2月23日</date>\n```\n\n \nThe \"2010\" is too long to be combined (4 digits), but the \"2\" and \"23\" will be affected.\n Since \"23\" is more than one [typographic character unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit),\n it will not be affected by [text-transform: full-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-transform).\n However since the \"2\" is only one typographic character unit,\n it will be transformed to a fullwidth \"２\".\n Since the \"2010\" was not combined, its digits, too, will be transformed to fullwidth \"２０１０\";\n and being fullwidth, they will be typeset upright, giving the following result: \n\n```\n２\n０\n１\n０\n年\n２\n月\n23\n日\n```\n\n \n \n Properties that affect glyph selection,\n such as the [font-variant](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-variant) and [font-feature-settings](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-feature-settings) properties defined in [[CSS3-FONTS]](#biblio-css3-fonts),\n can potentially affect the selection of variants for characters included in combined text runs.\n Authors are advised to use these properties with care when [text-combine-upright](#propdef-text-combine-upright) is also used.",

[[RFC2119]](#biblio-rfc2119) \n\n \nExamples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”\n or are set apart from the normative text with `class=\"example\"`,\n like this: \n\n \n [](#example-ae2b6bc0)\n \nThis is an example of an informative example. \n\n \n \nInformative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the\n normative text with `class=\"note\"`, like this: \n\n \nNote, this is an informative note. \n\n \nAdvisements are normative sections styled to evoke special attention and are\n set apart from other normative text with `<strong class=\"advisement\">`, like\n this: UAs MUST provide an accessible alternative. \n\n Conformance classes[](#conform-classes)\n \nConformance to this specification\n is defined for three conformance classes: \n\n \n style sheet\n A [CSS\n style sheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#style-sheet).\n renderer\n A [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#user-agent) that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders\n documents that use them.\n authoring tool\n A [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#user-agent) that writes a style sheet.\n \n \nA style sheet is conformant to this specification\n if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid\n according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each\n feature defined in this module. \n\n \nA renderer is conformant to this specification\n if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the\n appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined\n by this specification by parsing them correctly\n and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a\n UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device\n does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not\n required to render color on a monochrome monitor.) \n\n \nAn authoring tool is conformant to this specification\n if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the\n generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in\n this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets\n as described in this module. \n\n Requirements for Responsible Implementation of CSS[](#conform-responsible)\n \nThe following sections define several conformance requirements\n for implementing CSS responsibly,\n in a way that promotes interoperability in the present and future. \n\n Partial Implementations[](#conform-partial)\n \nSo that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to assign fallback values, CSS renderers must treat as invalid\n (and [ignore as appropriate](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore))\n any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords, and other syntactic constructs\n for which they have no usable level of support.\n In particular, user agents must not selectively ignore\n unsupported property values and honor supported values in a single multi-value property declaration:\n if any value is considered invalid (as unsupported values must be),\n CSS requires that the entire declaration be ignored. \n\n Implementations of Unstable and Proprietary Features[](#conform-future-proofing)\n \nTo avoid clashes with future stable CSS features,\n the CSSWG recommends [following best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#future-proofing) for the implementation of [unstable](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#unstable) features and [proprietary extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#proprietary-extension) to CSS. \n\n Implementations of CR-level Features[](#conform-testing)\n \nOnce a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,\n implementers should release an [unprefixed](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#vendor-prefix) implementation\n of any CR-level feature they can demonstrate\n to be correctly implemented according to spec,\n and should avoid exposing a prefixed variant of that feature. \n\n \nTo establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across\n implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental\n CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the\n testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before\n releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases\n submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS\n Working Group. \n\n \nFurther information on submitting testcases and implementation reports\n can be found from on the CSS Working Group’s website at [https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/).\n Questions should be directed to the [public-css-testsuite@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite) mailing list. \n\n CR exit criteria[](#cr-exit-criteria)\n \n For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,\n there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations\n of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of\n products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by\n a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the\n following terms: \n\n \n independent\n each implementation must be developed by a\n different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code\n used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that\n have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are\n exempt from this requirement.\n interoperable\n passing the respective test case(s) in the\n official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web\n browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test\n suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user\n agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition\n if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there\n must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those\n equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of\n interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly\n available for the purposes of peer review.\n implementation\n \n a user agent which:\n \n\n implements the specification.\n is available to the general public. The implementation may\n be a shipping product or other publicly available version\n (i.e., beta version, preview release, or \"nightly build\").\n Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the\n feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to\n demonstrate stability.\n is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed\n to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage\n going forward).\n \n\n \n \n\n The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least\n six months.",
