In certain cases, a box may **overflow**, meaning its\ncontent lies partly or entirely outside of the box, e.g.:\n\n- A line cannot be broken, causing the line box to be wider than the\nblock box.\n\n- A block-level box is too wide for the containing block. This may\nhappen when an\nelement's ['width'](visudet.html#propdef-width) property has a\nvalue that causes the generated block box to spill over\nsides of the containing block.\n\n- An element's height exceeds an explicit height assigned to the containing\nblock (i.e., the containing block's height is determined by the ['height'](visudet.html#propdef-height) property, not by content\nheight).\n\n- A descendant box is [positioned\nabsolutely](visuren.html#absolute-positioning), partly outside the box. Such boxes are not always\nclipped by the overflow property on their ancestors; specifically,\nthey are not clipped by the overflow of any ancestor between\nthemselves and their containing block\n\n- A descendant box has [negative margins](box.html#margin-properties), causing it\nto be positioned partly outside the box.\n\n- The 'text-indent' property causes an inline box to hang off either the left or right edge of the block box.\n\nWhenever overflow occurs, the ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) property specifies \nwhether a box is clipped to its padding edge, and if so, whether \na scrolling mechanism is provided to access any clipped out content.",

It affects the clipping \nof all of the element's content except any descendant elements (and \ntheir respective content and descendants) whose containing block is the viewport or an ancestor of the element. Values have the following meanings:\n\nvisible\n\nThis value indicates that content is not clipped, i.e., it\nmay be rendered outside the block box. \n\nhidden\n\nThis value indicates that the content is clipped and that no\nscrolling user interface should be provided to view the content outside the\nclipping region.\n\nscroll\n\nThis value indicates that the content is clipped and that if the\nuser agent uses a scrolling mechanism that is visible on the screen\n(such as a scroll bar or a panner), that mechanism should be displayed\nfor a box whether or not any of its content is clipped. This avoids\nany problem with scrollbars appearing and disappearing in a dynamic\nenvironment. \nWhen this value is specified and the target medium is\n'print', overflowing content may be printed.\nWhen used on [table boxes,](tables.html#table-box) this\nvalue has the same meaning as 'visible'.\n\nauto\n\nThe behavior of the 'auto' value is user agent-dependent, but\nshould cause a scrolling mechanism to be provided for overflowing boxes.\nWhen used on [table boxes,](tables.html#table-box) this\nvalue has the same meaning as 'visible'.\n\n Even if ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) is set\nto 'visible', content may be clipped to a UA's document window by the\nnative operating environment.\n\nOn a table element ('display: table'), 'overflow' applies to the [table box](tables.html#table-box) (i.e., not the [table wrapper box](tables.html#table-wrapper-box)) and all\nvalues other than 'hidden' are treated as 'visible'.\n\nUAs must apply the 'overflow' property set on the root element to\nthe viewport.\nWhen the root element is an HTML \"HTML\" element or an XHTML \"html\" \nelement, and that element has an HTML \"BODY\" element or an XHTML \n\"body\" element as a child, user agents must instead apply the \n'overflow' property from the first such child element to the \nviewport, if the value on the root element is 'visible'.\nThe 'visible' value when used for the viewport\nmust be interpreted as 'auto'. The element from which the value is\npropagated must have a used value for 'overflow' of 'visible'.\n\nIn the case of a scrollbar being placed on an edge of the element's\nbox, it should be inserted between the inner border edge and the outer\npadding edge. Any space taken up by the scrollbars should be taken out\nof (subtracted from the dimensions of) the containing block formed by\nthe element with the scrollbars.\n\nExample(s):\n\nConsider the following example of a block quotation\n(`<blockquote>`) that is too big\nfor its containing block (established by a `<div>`). Here is\nthe source:\n\n```\n\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I didn't like the play, but then I saw\nit under adverse conditions - the curtain was up.</p>\n<cite>- Groucho Marx</cite>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nHere is the style sheet controlling the sizes and style of the\ngenerated boxes:\n\n```\n\ndiv { width : 100px; height: 100px;\n border: thin solid red;\n }\n\nblockquote { width : 125px; height : 100px;\n margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 50px; \n border: thin dashed black\n }\n\ncite { display: block;\n text-align : right; \n border: none\n }\n\n```\n\nThe initial value of ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) is 'visible', so\nthe `<blockquote>` would be formatted without clipping, something like this:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/overflow1-desc.html)\n\nSetting ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) to\n'hidden' for the `<div>`, on the other hand, causes the\n`<blockquote>` to be clipped by the containing\n`<div>`:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/overflow2-desc.html)\n\nA value of 'scroll' would tell UAs that support \na visible scrolling mechanism to display one so that users\ncould access the clipped content.\n\nFinally, consider this case where an absolutely positioned element\nis mixed with an overflow parent.\n\nStyle sheet:\n\n```\n\n container { position: relative; border: solid; }\n scroller { overflow: scroll; height: 5em; margin: 5em; }\n satellite { position: absolute; top: 0; }\n body { height: 10em; }\n\n```\n\nDocument fragment:\n\n```\n\n <container>\n <scroller>\n <satellite/>\n <body/>\n </scroller>\n </container>\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"scroller\" element will not scroll the\n\"satellite\" element, because the latter's containing block is outside\nthe element whose overflow is being clipped and scrolled.",

      "content": "A **clipping\nregion** defines what portion of an element's \nborder box \n \nis visible. By default, the element is not clipped. However, the clipping region may be explicitly set with the ['clip'](visufx.html#propdef-clip) property.\n\n \n \n Name:\n **clip**Value:[<shape>](visufx.html#value-def-shape) | auto | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:auto\nApplies to:absolutely positioned elements\nInherited:no\nPercentages:N/A\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:'auto' if specified as 'auto', otherwise a rectangle with four\n values, each of which is 'auto' if specified as 'auto' and the\n computed length otherwise\n\nThe 'clip' property applies only to absolutely positioned elements.\nValues have the following meanings:\n\nauto\nThe element does not clip.\n\n<shape>\nIn CSS 2.2, the only valid <shape> value is:\nrect([<top>](visufx.html#value-def-top), [<right>](visufx.html#value-def-right), [<bottom>](visufx.html#value-def-bottom), [<left>](visufx.html#value-def-left))\n\nwhere [<top>](visufx.html#value-def-top) and [<bottom>](visufx.html#value-def-bottom) specify offsets from\nthe top border edge of the box, and [<right>](visufx.html#value-def-right), and [<left>](visufx.html#value-def-left) specify offsets from the\nleft border edge of the box. Authors should separate\noffset values with commas. User agents must support separation with\ncommas, but may also support separation without commas (but not a\ncombination), because a\nprevious revision of this specification was ambiguous in this respect.\n\n<top>, <right>,\n<bottom>,\nand <left> may\neither have a [<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length)\nvalue or 'auto'. Negative lengths are permitted. The value 'auto'\nmeans that a given edge of the clipping region will be the same as the\nedge of the element's generated border box (i.e., 'auto' means the same as '0' for [<top>](visufx.html#value-def-top) and [<left>](visufx.html#value-def-left), the same as the used\nvalue of the height plus the sum of\nvertical padding and border widths for [<bottom>](visufx.html#value-def-right), and the same as the\nused value of the width plus the sum of the horizontal padding and\nborder widths for [<right>](visufx.html#value-def-right),\nsuch that four 'auto' values result in the clipping region being \nthe same as the element's border box).\n\nWhen coordinates are rounded to pixel coordinates, care should be\ntaken that no pixels remain visible when <left> and\n<right> have the same value (or <top> and <bottom>\nhave the same value), and conversely that no pixels within the\nelement's border box remain hidden when these values are 'auto'.\n\nAn element's clipping region clips out any aspect of the element (e.g., content, children, background, borders, text decoration, outline and visible scrolling mechanism — if any) that is outside the clipping region.\nContent that has been clipped does not cause overflow.\n\nThe element's ancestors may also clip portions of their content (e.g., via their own ['clip'](visufx.html#propdef-clip) property and/or if \ntheir ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) property is\nnot 'visible'); what is rendered is the cumulative intersection.\n\nIf the clipping region exceeds the bounds of the UA's\ndocument window, content may be clipped to that window by the\nnative operating environment.\n\nExample(s):\n\nExample:\nThe following two rules:\n\n```\np#one { clip: rect(5px, 40px, 45px, 5px); }\np#two { clip: rect(5px, 55px, 45px, 5px); }\n```\n\nand assuming both Ps are 50 by 55 px, will create, respectively,\nthe rectangular clipping regions delimited\nby the dashed lines in the following illustrations:\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/clip-desc.html)\n\n Note. In CSS 2.2, all clipping\nregions are rectangular. We anticipate future extensions to permit\nnon-rectangular clipping. Future updates may also reintroduce a\nsyntax for offsetting shapes from each edge instead of offsetting from\na point.",
