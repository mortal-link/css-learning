      "content": "This section is not normative.\n\n \nThe CSS [visual formatting model](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html) describes a coordinate system within each element is positioned. Positions and sizes in this coordinate space can be thought of as being expressed in pixels, starting in the origin of point with positive values proceeding to the right and down.\n\n \nThis coordinate space can be modified with the [transform](#propdef-transform) property. Using transform, elements can be translated, rotated and scaled.\n\n 1.1. Module Interactions[](#module-interactions)\n \nThis module defines a set of CSS properties that affect the visual rendering of elements to which those properties are applied; these effects are applied after elements have been sized and positioned according to the [visual formatting model](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2). Some values of these properties result in the creation of a [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block), and/or the creation of a [stacking context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-positioning/#stacking-context).\n\n \nTransforms affect the rendering of backgrounds on elements with a value of [fixed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-attachment-fixed) for the [background-attachment](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-attachment) property, which is specified in [[CSS3BG]](#biblio-css3bg).\n\n \nTransforms affect the client rectangles returned by the Element Interface Extensions [getClientRects()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#dom-element-getclientrects) and [getBoundingClientRect()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#dom-element-getboundingclientrect), which are specified in [[CSSOM-VIEW]](#biblio-cssom-view).\n\n \nTransforms affect the computation of the [scrollable overflow region](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region) as described by [[CSS-OVERFLOW-3]](#biblio-css-overflow-3).\n\n 1.2.

      "content": "This section is normative.\n\n \nSpecifying a value other than none for the [transform](#propdef-transform) property establishes a new [local coordinate system](#local-coordinate-system) at the element that it is applied to. The mapping from where the element would have rendered into that local coordinate system is given by the element’s [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix).\n\n \n The [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix) is computed from the [transform](#propdef-transform) and [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) properties as follows: \n\n \n\n \n \nStart with the identity matrix.\n\n \n \nTranslate by the computed X and Y of [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin)\n\n \n \nMultiply by each of the transform functions in [transform](#propdef-transform) property from left to right\n\n \n \nTranslate by the negated computed X and Y values of [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin)\n\n \n\n \n [](#example-192d2b11)\n \nAn element has a [transform](#propdef-transform) property that is not none.\n\n```\ndiv {\n transform-origin: 0 0;\n transform: translate(-10px, -20px) scale(2) rotate(45deg);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThe [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) property is set to 0 0 and can be omitted. The [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix) TM gets computed by post-multying the [<translate()>](#funcdef-transform-translate), [<scale()>](#funcdef-transform-scale) and [<rotate()>](#funcdef-transform-rotate) [<transform-function>](#typedef-transform-function)s.\n\n \n\n \n \nTransforms apply to [transformable elements](#transformable-element).\n\n \nThe coordinate space is a coordinate system with two axes: the X axis increases horizontally to the right; the Y axis increases vertically downwards.\n\n \nTransformations are cumulative. That is, elements establish their local coordinate system within the coordinate system of their parent.\n\n \nTo map a point plocal with the coordinate pair xlocal and ylocal from the [local coordinate system](#local-coordinate-system) of an element into the parent’s coordinate system, post-multiply the [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix) TM of the element by plocal. The result is the mapped point pparent with the coordinate pair xparent and yparent in the parent’s local coordinate system.\n\n \n\n \nFrom the perspective of the user, an element effectively accumulates all the [transform](#propdef-transform) properties of its ancestors as well as any local transform applied to it. The accumulation of these transforms defines a [current transformation matrix](#current-transformation-matrix) (CTM) for the element.\n\n \n The [current transformation matrix](#current-transformation-matrix) is computed by post-multiplying all transformation matrices starting from the [viewport coordinate system](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/coords.html#TermViewportCoordinateSystem) and ending with the [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix) of an element. \n\n \n [](#example-63675dc3) This example has multiple, nested elements in an SVG document. Some elements get transformed by a [transformation matrix](#transformation-matrix).\n\n```\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n <g transform=\"translate(-10, 20)\">\n <g transform=\"scale(2)\">\n <rect width=\"200\" height=\"200\" transform=\"rotate(45)\"/>\n </g>\n </g>\n</svg>\n\n```\n\n \n\n \n \ntranslate(-10, 20) computes to the transformation matrix T1\n\n \n \nscale(2) computes to the transformation matrix T2\n\n \n \nrotate(45) computes to the transformation matrix T3\n\n \n\n \nThe CTM for the SVG [rect](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/shapes.html#elementdef-rect) element is the result of multiplying T1, T2 and T3 in order.\n\n \n\n \nTo map a point plocal with the coordinate pair xlocal and ylocal from the [local coordinate system](#local-coordinate-system) of the SVG [rect](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/shapes.html#elementdef-rect) element into the [viewport coordinate system](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/coords.html#TermViewportCoordinateSystem), post-multiply the [current transformation matrix](#current-transformation-matrix) CTM of the element by plocal. The result is the mapped point pviewport with the coordinate pair xviewport and yviewport in the viewport coordinate system.\n\n \n\n \n \nNote: Transformations do affect the visual rendering, but have no affect on the CSS layout other than affecting overflow. Transforms are also taken into account when computing client rectangles exposed via the Element Interface Extensions, namely [getClientRects()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#dom-element-getclientrects) and [getBoundingClientRect()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#dom-element-getboundingclientrect), which are specified in [[CSSOM-VIEW]](#biblio-cssom-view).\n\n \n [](#example-76e5e4e0)\n\n```\ndiv {\n transform: translate(100px, 100px);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThis transform moves the element by 100 pixels in both the X and Y directions.\n\n \n \n \n [](#example-f319ce51)\n\n```\ndiv {\n height: 100px; width: 100px;\n transform-origin: 50px 50px;\n transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThe [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) property moves the point of origin by 50 pixels in both the X and Y directions. The transform rotates the element clockwise by 45° about the point of origin. After all transform functions were applied, the translation of the origin gets translated back by -50 pixels in both the X and Y directions.\n\n \n \n \n [](#example-cc93ebae)\n\n```\ndiv {\n height: 100px; width: 100px;\n transform: translate(80px, 80px) scale(1.5, 1.5) rotate(45deg);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThe visual appareance is as if the [div](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element) element gets translated by 80px to the bottom left direction, then scaled up by 150% and finally rotated by 45°.\n\n \nEach [<transform-function>](#typedef-transform-function) can get represented by a corresponding 4x4 matrix. To map a point from the coordinate space of the [div](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element) box to the coordinate space of the parent element, these transforms get multiplied in the reverse order:\n\n \n\n \n \nThe rotation matrix gets [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied) by the scale matrix.\n\n \n \nThe result of the previous multiplication is then [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied) by the translation matrix to create the accumulated transformation matrix.\n\n \n \nFinally, the point to map gets [pre-multiplied](#pre-multiplied) with the accumulated transformation matrix.\n\n \n\n \nFor more details see [The Transform Function Lists](#transform-function-lists).\n\n \n \nNote: The identical rendering can be obtained by nesting elements with the equivalent transforms:\n\n```\n<div style=\"transform: translate(80px, 80px)\">\n <div style=\"transform: scale(1.5, 1.5)\">\n <div style=\"transform: rotate(45deg)\"></div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n \n \nFor elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, the transform property does not affect the flow of the content surrounding the transformed element. However, the extent of the overflow area takes into account transformed elements. This behavior is similar to what happens when elements are offset via relative positioning. Therefore, if the value of the [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-overflow) property is [scroll](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#valdef-overflow-scroll) or [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#valdef-overflow-auto), scrollbars will appear as needed to see content that is transformed outside the visible area. Specifically, transforms can extend (but do not shrink) the size of the overflow area, which is computed as the union of the bounds of the elements before and after the application of transforms.\n\n \nFor elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, any value other than none for the [transform](#propdef-transform) property results in the creation of a stacking context. Implementations must paint the layer it creates, within its parent stacking context, at the same stacking order that would be used if it were a positioned element with [z-index: 0](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-positioning/#propdef-z-index). If an element with a transform is positioned, the z-index property applies as described in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2), except that [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-positioning/#valdef-z-index-auto) is treated as 0 since a new stacking context is always created.\n\n \nFor elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, any value other than none for the [transform](#propdef-transform) property also causes the element to establish a **containing block for all descendants**. Its padding box will be used to layout for all of its absolute-position descendants, fixed-position descendants, and descendant fixed background attachments.\n\n \n [](#example-02d1d5ba) To demostrate the effect of [containing block for all descendants](#containing-block-for-all-descendants) on fixed-position descendants, the following code snippets should behave identically:\n\n```\n<style>\n#container {\n width: 300px;\n height: 200px;\n border: 5px dashed black;\n padding: 5px;\n overflow: scroll;\n}\n\n#bloat {\n height: 1000px;\n}\n\n#child {\n right: 0;\n bottom: 0;\n width: 10%;\n height: 10%;\n background: green;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"transform:translateX(5px);\">\n <div id=\"bloat\"></div>\n <div id=\"child\" style=\"position:fixed;\"></div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n \nversus\n\n```\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"position:relative; z-index:0; left:5px;\">\n <div id=\"bloat\"></div>\n <div id=\"child\" style=\"position:absolute;\"></div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n \n \n[Fixed backgrounds](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-attachment-fixed) on the root element are affected by any transform specified for that element. For all other elements that are effected by a transform (i.e. have a transform applied to them, or to any of their ancestor elements), a value of [fixed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-attachment-fixed) for the [background-attachment](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-attachment) property is treated as if it had a value of [scroll](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-attachment-scroll). The computed value of background-attachment is not affected.\n\n \nNote: If the root element is transformed, the transformation applies to the entire canvas, including any background specified for the root element. Since [the background painting area for the root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#special-backgrounds) is the entire canvas, which is infinite, the transformation might cause parts of the background that were originally off-screen to appear. For example, if the root element’s background were repeating dots, and a transformation of scale(0.5) were specified on the root element, the dots would shrink to half their size, but there will be twice as many, so they still cover the whole viewport.",

SVG presentation attributes[](#transform-attribute-specificity)\n \nThe [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) CSS property is also a [presentation attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/styling.html#TermPresentationAttribute) and extends the list of existing presentation attributes [[SVG2]](#biblio-svg2).\n\n \nSVG 2 defines the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)`, `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` attributes as [presentation attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/styling.html#TermPresentationAttribute), represented by the CSS [transform](#propdef-transform) property [[SVG2]](#biblio-svg2).\n\n \nThe participation in the CSS cascade is determined by the specificity of [presentation attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/styling.html#TermPresentationAttribute) in the SVG specification. According to SVG, user agents conceptually insert a [new author style sheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html#PresentationAttributes) for presentation attributes, which is the first in the author style sheet collection [[SVG2]](#biblio-svg2).\n\n \n [](#example-ae528470) This example shows the combination of the [transform](#propdef-transform) style property and the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute.\n\n```\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n <style>\n .container {\n transform: translate(100px, 100px);\n }\n </style>\n\n <g class=\"container\" transform=\"translate(200 200)\">\n <rect width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"blue\" />\n </g>\n</svg>\n\n```\n\n \n \nBecause of the participation to the CSS cascade, the [transform](#propdef-transform) style property overrides the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute. Therefore the container gets translated by 100px in both the horizontal and the vertical directions, instead of 200px.\n\n \n 7.2. Syntax of the SVG [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute[](#svg-syntax)\n \nFor backwards compatibility reasons, the syntax of the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)`, `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` attributes differ from the syntax of the [transform](#propdef-transform) CSS property. For the attributes, there is no support for additional [<transform-function>](#typedef-transform-function)s defined for the CSS transform property. Specifically, [<translateX()>](#funcdef-transform-translatex), [<translateY()>](#funcdef-transform-translatey), [<scaleX()>](#funcdef-transform-scalex), [<scaleY()>](#funcdef-transform-scaley) and [<skew()>](#funcdef-transform-skew) are not supported by the transform, `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)`, `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` attributes.\n\n \nThe following list uses the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to define values for the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), [patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute) and [gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute) attributes followed by an informative rail road diagram.

The behavior is equivalent to an initial translation by cx, cy, a rotation defined by the first number value interpreted as [<angle>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#angle-value) type with [deg](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#deg) unit followed by a translation by -cx, -cy.\n\n \nA [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute can be the start or end value of a CSS Transition. If the value of a transform attribute is the start or end value of a CSS Transition and the SVG [transform list](#svg-transform-list) contains at least one [rotate](#svg-rotate) transform function with 3 values, the individual SVG transform functions must get [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied) and the resulting matrix must get mapped to a [<matrix()>](#funcdef-transform-matrix) CSS [<transform-function>](#typedef-transform-function) and used as start/end value of the CSS Transition.\n\n 7.4. User coordinate space[](#svg-user-coordinate-space)\n \nFor the `[pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-pattern)` element, the `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)` attribtue and [transform](#propdef-transform) property define an additional transformation in the pattern coordinate system. See `[patternUnits](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternUnitsAttribute)` attribute for details [[SVG2]](#biblio-svg2).\n\n \nFor the `[linearGradient](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-linearGradient)` and `[radialGradient](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-radialGradient)` elements, the `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` attribtue and [transform](#propdef-transform) property define an additional transformation in the gradient coordinate system. See `[gradientUnits](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientUnitsAttribute)` attribute for details [[SVG2]](#biblio-svg2).\n\n \nFor the `[clipPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1/#elementdef-clippath)` element, the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribtue and [transform](#propdef-transform) property define an additional transformation in the clipping path coordinate space. See `[clipPathUnits](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1/#element-attrdef-clippathunits)` attribute for details [[CSS-MASKING]](#biblio-css-masking).\n\n \nFor all other [transformable elements](#transformable-element) the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute and [transform](#propdef-transform) property define a transformation in the current user coordinate system of the parent. All percentage values of the transform attribute are relative to the element’s [reference box](#reference-box).\n\n \n [](#example-bb84e563)\n \nThe [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) property on the pattern in the following example specifies a 50% translation of the origin in the horizontal and vertical dimension. The [transform](#propdef-transform) property specifies a translation as well, but in absolute lengths.\n\n```\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n <style>\n pattern {\n transform: rotate(45deg);\n transform-origin: 50% 50%;\n }\n </style>\n\n <defs>\n <pattern id=\"pattern-1\">\n <rect id=\"rect1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"blue\" />\n </pattern>\n </defs>\n\n <rect width=\"200\" height=\"200\" fill=\"url(#pattern-1)\" />\n</svg>\n\n```\n\n \nAn SVG `[pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-pattern)` element doesn’t have a bounding box. The [reference box](#reference-box) of the referencing `[rect](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/shapes.html#elementdef-rect)` element is used instead to solve the relative values of the [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) property. Therefore the point of origin will get translated by 100 pixels temporarily to rotate the user space of the `[pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-pattern)` elements content.\n\n \n 7.5. SVG DOM interface for the [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute) attribute[](#transform-attribute-dom)\n \nThe SVG specification defines the \"[SVGAnimatedTransformList](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-SVG11-20110816/coords.html#InterfaceSVGAnimatedTransformList)\" interface in the SVG DOM to provide access to the animated and the base value of the SVG [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` and `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)` attributes. To ensure backwards compatibility, this API must still be supported by user agents.\n\n \nbaseVal gives the author the possibility to access and modify the values of the SVG [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)`, `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` attributes. To provide the necessary backwards compatibility to the SVG DOM, baseVal must reflect the values of this author style sheet. All modifications to SVG DOM objects of baseVal must affect this author style sheet immediately.\n\n \nanimVal represents the computed style of the [transform](#propdef-transform) property.

The `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` and `[set](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#SetElement)` element[](#svg-animate-element)\n \nWith this specification, the `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` element and the `[set](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#SetElement)` element can animate the data type [<transform-list>](#typedef-transform-list).\n\n \nThe animation effect is [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied) to the underlying value for additive `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` animations (see below) instead of added to the underlying value, due to the specific behavior of [<transform-list>](#typedef-transform-list) animations.\n\n \nFrom-to, from-by and by animations are defined in SMIL to be equivalent to a corresponding values animation. However, to animations are a mixture of additive and non-additive behavior [[SMIL3]](#biblio-smil3).\n\n \nTo animations on `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` provide specific functionality to get a smooth change from the underlying value to the to attribute value, which conflicts mathematically with the requirement for additive transform animations to be [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied). As a consequence, the behavior of to animations for `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` is undefined. Authors are suggested to use from-to, from-by, by or values animations to achieve any desired transform animation.\n\n \nThe value \"paced\" is undefined for the attribute calcMode on `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` for animations of the data type [<transform-list>](#typedef-transform-list). If specified, UAs may choose the value \"linear\" instead. Future versions of this specification may define how paced animations can be performed on <transform-list>.\n\n \nNote: The following paragraphs extend [Elements, attributes and properties that can be animated](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#complexDistances) [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11).\n\n \nThe introduced presentation attributes [transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#TransformAttribute), `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)`, `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` and [transform-origin](#propdef-transform-origin) are animatable.\n\n \nWith this specification the SVG basic data type [<transform-list>](#typedef-transform-list) is equivalent to a list of [<transform-function>](#typedef-transform-function)s. <transform-list> is animatable and additive. The data type can be animated using the SVG `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` element and the SVG `[set](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#SetElement)` element. SVG animations must run the same animation steps as described in section [Transitions and Animations between Transform Values](#interpolation-of-transforms).\n\n \n Animatable data types\n \n \n Data type\n Additive?\n `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)`\n `[set](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#SetElement)`\n `[animateColor](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateColorElement)`\n `[animateTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateTransformElement)`\n Notes\n \n \n [<transform-list>](#typedef-transform-list)\n yes\n yes\n yes\n no\n yes\n Additive for `[animateTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateTransformElement)` means that a transformation is [post-multiplied](#post-multiplied) to the base set of transformations.\n \n 8.2. Neutral element for addition[](#neutral-element)\n \nSome animations require a neutral element for addition. For transform functions this is a scalar or a list of scalars of 0. Examples of neutral elements for transform functions are translate(0), scale(0), rotate(0), skewX(0), skewY(0).\n\n \nNote: This paragraph focuses on the requirements of [[SMIL]](#biblio-smil) and the extension defined by [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11). This specification does not provide definitions of neutral elements for the other transform functions than the functions listed above.\n\n \n [](#example-cdcd611e)\n \nA by animation with a by value vb is equivalent to the same animation with a values list with 2 values, the neutral element for addition for the domain of the target attribute (denoted 0) and vb, and additive=\"sum\". [[SMIL3]](#biblio-smil3)\n\n```\n<rect width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n <animateTransform attributeName=\"transform\" attributeType=\"XML\"\n type=\"scale\" by=\"1\" dur=\"5s\" fill=\"freeze\"/>\n</rect>\n\n```\n\n \nThe neutral element for addition when performing a by animation with type=\"scale\" is the value 0. Thus, performing the animation of the example above causes the rectangle to be invisible at time 0s (since the animated transform list value is scale(0)), and be scaled back to its original size at time 5s (since the animated transform list value is scale(1)).\n\n \n 8.3. The SVG 1.1 '[attributeName](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#TargetAttributes)' attribute[](#svg-attribute-name)\n \n[SVG 1.1 Animation](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html) defines the \"[attributeName](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#TargetAttributes)\" attribute to specify the name of the target attribute. For the presentation attributes `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` and `[patternTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementPatternTransformAttribute)` it will also be possible to use the value [transform](#propdef-transform). The same transform property will get animated.\n\n \n [](#example-d0ce0589)\n \nIn this example the gradient transformation of the linear gradient gets animated.\n\n```\n<linearGradient gradientTransform=\"scale(2)\">\n <animate attributeName=\"gradientTransform\" from=\"scale(2)\" to=\"scale(4)\"\n dur=\"3s\" additive=\"sum\"/>\n <animate attributeName=\"transform\" from=\"translate(0, 0)\" to=\"translate(100px, 100px)\"\n dur=\"3s\" additive=\"sum\"/>\n</linearGradient>\n\n```\n\n \nThe `[linearGradient](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg2/pservers.html#elementdef-linearGradient)` element specifies the `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` presentation attribute. The two `[animate](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AnimateElement)` elements address the target attribute `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` and [transform](#propdef-transform). Even so all animations apply to the same gradient transformation by taking the value of the `[gradientTransform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute)` presentation attribute, applying the scaling of the first animation and applying the translation of the second animation one after the other.",

With the usage of transition, an author might expect a animated, clockwise rotation by three and a quarter turns (1170°).\n\n```\n<style>\ndiv {\n transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\ndiv:hover {\n transform: translate(100px, 100px) rotate(1215deg);\n transition: transform 3s;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div></div>\n\n```\n\n \nThe number of transform functions on the source transform rotate(45deg) differs from the number of transform functions on the destination transform translate(100px, 100px) rotate(1125deg). According to the last rule of [Interpolation of Transforms](#interpolation-of-transforms), both transforms must be interpolated by matrix interpolation. With converting the transformation functions to matrices, the information about the three turns gets lost and the element gets rotated by just a quarter turn (90°).\n\n \nTo achieve the three and a quarter turns for the example above, source and destination transforms must fulfill the third rule of [Interpolation of Transforms](#interpolation-of-transforms). Source transform could look like translate(0, 0) rotate(45deg) for a linear interpolation of the transform functions.\n\n \n \nIn the following we differ between the [interpolation of two 2D matrices](#interpolation-of-2d-matrices) and the interpolation of two matrices where at least one matrix is not a [2D matrix](#2d-matrix).\n\n \nIf one of the matrices for interpolation is non-invertible, the used animation function must fall-back to a discrete animation according to the rules of the respective animation specification.\n\n 13.1. Supporting functions[](#supporting-functions)\n \nThe pseudo code in the next subsections make use of the following supporting functions:\n\n```\nSupporting functions (point is a 3 component vector, matrix is a 4x4 matrix, vector is a 4 component vector):\n double determinant(matrix) returns the 4x4 determinant of the matrix\n matrix inverse(matrix) returns the inverse of the passed matrix\n matrix transpose(matrix) returns the transpose of the passed matrix\n point multVecMatrix(point, matrix) multiplies the passed point by the passed matrix\n and returns the transformed point\n double length(point) returns the length of the passed vector\n point normalize(point) normalizes the length of the passed point to 1\n double dot(point, point) returns the dot product of the passed points\n double sqrt(double) returns the root square of passed value\n double max(double y, double x) returns the bigger value of the two passed values\n double dot(vector, vector) returns the dot product of the passed vectors\n vector multVector(vector, vector) multiplies the passed vectors\n double sqrt(double) returns the root square of passed value\n double max(double y, double x) returns the bigger value of the two passed values\n double min(double y, double x) returns the smaller value of the two passed values\n double cos(double) returns the cosines of passed value\n double sin(double) returns the sine of passed value\n double acos(double) returns the inverse cosine of passed value\n double abs(double) returns the absolute value of the passed value\n double rad2deg(double) transforms a value in radian to degree and returns it\n double deg2rad(double) transforms a value in degree to radian and returns it\n\nDecomposition also makes use of the following function:\n point combine(point a, point b, double ascl, double bscl)\n result[0] = (ascl * a[0]) + (bscl * b[0])\n result[1] = (ascl * a[1]) + (bscl * b[1])\n result[2] = (ascl * a[2]) + (bscl * b[2])\n return result\n\n```\n\n 13.2. Interpolation of 2D matrices[](#interpolation-of-2d-matrices)\n 13.2.1. Decomposing a 2D matrix[](#decomposing-a-2d-matrix)\n \nThe pseudo code below is based upon the \"unmatrix\" method in \"Graphics Gems II, edited by Jim Arvo\".\n\n \nMatrices in the pseudo code use the column-major order. The first index on a matrix entry represents the column and the second index represents the row.\n\n```\nInput: matrix ; a 4x4 matrix\nOutput: translation ; a 2 component vector\n scale ; a 2 component vector\n angle ; rotation\n m11 ; 1,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m12 ; 1,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m21 ; 2,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m22 ; 2,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\nReturns false if the matrix cannot be decomposed, true if it can\n\ndouble row0x = matrix[0][0]\ndouble row0y = matrix[0][1]\ndouble row1x = matrix[1][0]\ndouble row1y = matrix[1][1]\n\ntranslate[0] = matrix[3][0]\ntranslate[1] = matrix[3][1]\n\nscale[0] = sqrt(row0x * row0x + row0y * row0y)\nscale[1] = sqrt(row1x * row1x + row1y * row1y)\n\n// If determinant is negative, one axis was flipped.\ndouble determinant = row0x * row1y - row0y * row1x\nif (determinant < 0)\n // Flip axis with minimum unit vector dot product.\n if (row0x < row1y)\n scale[0] = -scale[0]\n else\n scale[1] = -scale[1]\n\n// Renormalize matrix to remove scale.\nif (scale[0])\n row0x *= 1 / scale[0]\n row0y *= 1 / scale[0]\nif (scale[1])\n row1x *= 1 / scale[1]\n row1y *= 1 / scale[1]\n\n// Compute rotation and renormalize matrix.\nangle = atan2(row0y, row0x);\n\nif (angle)\n // Rotate(-angle) = [cos(angle), sin(angle), -sin(angle), cos(angle)]\n // = [row0x, -row0y, row0y, row0x]\n // Thanks to the normalization above.\n double sn = -row0y\n double cs = row0x\n double m11 = row0x\n double m12 = row0y\n double m21 = row1x\n double m22 = row1y\n row0x = cs * m11 + sn * m21\n row0y = cs * m12 + sn * m22\n row1x = -sn * m11 + cs * m21\n row1y = -sn * m12 + cs * m22\n\nm11 = row0x\nm12 = row0y\nm21 = row1x\nm22 = row1y\n\n// Convert into degrees because our rotation functions expect it.\nangle = rad2deg(angle)\n\nreturn true\n\n```\n\n 13.2.2. Interpolation of decomposed 2D matrix values [](#interpolation-of-decomposed-2d-matrix-values)\n \nBefore two decomposed 2D matrix values can be interpolated, the following\n\n```\nInput: translationA ; a 2 component vector\n scaleA ; a 2 component vector\n angleA ; rotation\n m11A ; 1,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m12A ; 1,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m21A ; 2,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m22A ; 2,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n translationB ; a 2 component vector\n scaleB ; a 2 component vector\n angleB ; rotation\n m11B ; 1,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m12B ; 1,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m21B ; 2,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m22B ; 2,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n\n// If x-axis of one is flipped, and y-axis of the other,\n// convert to an unflipped rotation.\nif ((scaleA[0] < 0 && scaleB[1] < 0) || (scaleA[1] < 0 && scaleB[0] < 0))\n scaleA[0] = -scaleA[0]\n scaleA[1] = -scaleA[1]\n angleA += angleA < 0 ? 180 : -180\n\n// Don’t rotate the long way around.\nif (!angleA)\n angleA = 360\nif (!angleB)\n angleB = 360\n\nif (abs(angleA - angleB) > 180)\n if (angleA > angleB)\n angleA -= 360\n else\n angleB -= 360\n\n```\n\n \nAfterwards, each component of the decomposed values translation, scale, angle, m11 to m22 of the source matrix get linearly interpolated with each corresponding component of the destination matrix.\n\n 13.2.3. Recomposing to a 2D matrix[](#recomposing-to-a-2d-matrix)\n \nAfter interpolation, the resulting values are used to transform the elements user space. One way to use these values is to recompose them into a 4x4 matrix. This can be done following the pseudo code below.\n\n \nMatrices in the pseudo code use the column-major order. The first index on a matrix entry represents the column and the second index represents the row.\n\n```\nInput: translation ; a 2 component vector\n scale ; a 2 component vector\n angle ; rotation\n m11 ; 1,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m12 ; 1,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m21 ; 2,1 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\n m22 ; 2,2 coordinate of 2x2 matrix\nOutput: matrix ; a 4x4 matrix initialized to identity matrix\n\nmatrix[0][0] = m11\nmatrix[0][1] = m12\nmatrix[1][0] = m21\nmatrix[1][1] = m22\n\n// Translate matrix.\nmatrix[3][0] = translate[0] * m11 + translate[1] * m21\nmatrix[3][1] = translate[0] * m12 + translate[1] * m22\n\n// Rotate matrix.\nangle = deg2rad(angle);\ndouble cosAngle = cos(angle);\ndouble sinAngle = sin(angle);\n\n// New temporary, identity initialized, 4x4 matrix rotateMatrix\nrotateMatrix[0][0] = cosAngle\nrotateMatrix[0][1] = sinAngle\nrotateMatrix[1][0] = -sinAngle\nrotateMatrix[1][1] = cosAngle\n\nmatrix = post-multiply(rotateMatrix, matrix)\n\n// Scale matrix.\nmatrix[0][0] *= scale[0]\nmatrix[0][1] *= scale[0]\nmatrix[1][0] *= scale[1]\nmatrix[1][1] *= scale[1]\n\n```",

The key words “MUST”,\n “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,\n “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this\n document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase\n letters in this specification. \n\n \nAll of the text of this specification is normative except sections\n explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[RFC2119]](#biblio-rfc2119) \n\n \nExamples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”\n or are set apart from the normative text with `class=\"example\"`,\n like this: \n\n \n [](#example-ae2b6bc0)\n \nThis is an example of an informative example. \n\n \n \nInformative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the\n normative text with `class=\"note\"`, like this: \n\n \nNote, this is an informative note. \n\n \nAdvisements are normative sections styled to evoke special attention and are\n set apart from other normative text with `<strong class=\"advisement\">`, like\n this: UAs MUST provide an accessible alternative. \n\n Conformance classes[](#conform-classes)\n \nConformance to this specification\n is defined for three conformance classes: \n\n \n style sheet\n A [CSS\n style sheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#style-sheet).\n renderer\n A [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#user-agent) that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders\n documents that use them.\n authoring tool\n A [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#user-agent) that writes a style sheet.\n \n \nA style sheet is conformant to this specification\n if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid\n according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each\n feature defined in this module. \n\n \nA renderer is conformant to this specification\n if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the\n appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined\n by this specification by parsing them correctly\n and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a\n UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device\n does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not\n required to render color on a monochrome monitor.) \n\n \nAn authoring tool is conformant to this specification\n if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the\n generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in\n this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets\n as described in this module. \n\n Requirements for Responsible Implementation of CSS[](#conform-responsible)\n \nThe following sections define several conformance requirements\n for implementing CSS responsibly,\n in a way that promotes interoperability in the present and future. \n\n Partial Implementations[](#conform-partial)\n \nSo that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to assign fallback values, CSS renderers must treat as invalid\n (and [ignore as appropriate](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore))\n any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords, and other syntactic constructs\n for which they have no usable level of support.\n In particular, user agents must not selectively ignore\n unsupported property values and honor supported values in a single multi-value property declaration:\n if any value is considered invalid (as unsupported values must be),\n CSS requires that the entire declaration be ignored. \n\n Implementations of Unstable and Proprietary Features[](#conform-future-proofing)\n \nTo avoid clashes with future stable CSS features,\n the CSSWG recommends [following best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#future-proofing) for the implementation of [unstable](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#unstable) features and [proprietary extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#proprietary-extension) to CSS. \n\n Implementations of CR-level Features[](#conform-testing)\n \nOnce a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,\n implementers should release an [unprefixed](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#vendor-prefix) implementation\n of any CR-level feature they can demonstrate\n to be correctly implemented according to spec,\n and should avoid exposing a prefixed variant of that feature. \n\n \nTo establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across\n implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental\n CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the\n testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before\n releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases\n submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS\n Working Group. \n\n \nFurther information on submitting testcases and implementation reports\n can be found from on the CSS Working Group’s website at [https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/).\n Questions should be directed to the [public-css-testsuite@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite) mailing list. \n\n CR exit criteria[](#cr-exit-criteria)\n \n For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,\n there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations\n of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of\n products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by\n a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the\n following terms: \n\n \n independent\n each implementation must be developed by a\n different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code\n used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that\n have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are\n exempt from this requirement.\n interoperable\n passing the respective test case(s) in the\n official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web\n browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test\n suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user\n agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition\n if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there\n must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those\n equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of\n interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly\n available for the purposes of peer review.\n implementation\n \n a user agent which:\n \n\n implements the specification.\n is available to the general public. The implementation may\n be a shipping product or other publicly available version\n (i.e., beta version, preview release, or \"nightly build\").\n Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the\n feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to\n demonstrate stability.\n is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed\n to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage\n going forward).\n \n\n \n \n\n The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least\n six months.",
