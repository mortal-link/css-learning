      "content": "This section is not normative.\n\n \nIt is often desirable to control the rate at which some value changes.\nFor example, gradually increasing the speed at which an element moves can\ngive the element a sense of weight as it appears to gather momentum.\nThis can be used to produce intuitive user interface elements or convincing\ncartoon props that behave like their physical counterparts.\nAlternatively, it is sometimes desirable for animation to move forwards in\ndistinct steps such as a segmented wheel that rotates such that the segments\nalways appear in the same position.\n\n \nSimilarly, controlling the rate of change of gradient interpolation can be\nused to produce different visual effects such as suggesting a concave or convex\nsurface, or producing a striped effect.\n\n \n[Easing functions](#easing-function) provide a means to transform such values by taking an\ninput progress value and producing a corresponding transformed output progress\nvalue.\n\n \n \n Example of an easing function that produces an ease-in effect. Given an input progress of 0.7, the easing function scales the\n value to produce an output progress of 0.52. Applying this easing function to an animation would cause it to progress\n more slowly at first but then gradually progress more quickly. \n \n 1.1. Value Definitions[](#values)\n \nThis specification uses the [value definition syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs) from [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [CSS-VALUES-3].\n Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.",

Output of\na step easing function[](#step-easing-algo)\n \nAt the exact point where a step occurs, the result of the function is\nconceptually the top of the step. However, an additional **before flag** passed as input to the [step easing function](#step-easing-function), if true, will cause the\nresult of the function to correspond to the bottom of the step at the step\npoint.\n\n \n [](#example-7b6395b6) \n \nAs an example of how the [before flag](#before-flag) affects the behavior of this function,\nconsider an animation with a [step easing function](#step-easing-function) whose [step\nposition](#step-position) is [start](#valdef-steps-start) and which has a positive\ndelay and backwards fill.\n\n \nFor example, using CSS animation:\n\n```\nanimation: moveRight 5s 1s steps(5, start);\n\n```\n\n \nDuring the delay phase, the [input progress value](#input-progress-value) will be zero but if the [before flag](#before-flag) is set to indicate that the animation has yet to reach its\nanimation interval, the easing function will produce zero as its [output\nprogress value](#output-progress-value), i.e. the bottom of the first step.\n\n \nAt the exact moment when the animation interval begins, the [input progress\nvalue](#input-progress-value) will still be zero, but the [before flag](#before-flag) will not be set and hence\nthe result of the easing function will correspond to the top of the first step.\n\n \n \nFor the purposes of calculating the [output progress value](#output-progress-value), the [step position](#step-position) [start](#valdef-steps-start) is considered equivalent to [jump-start](#valdef-steps-jump-start).\nLikewise [end](#valdef-steps-end) is considered equivalent to [jump-end](#valdef-steps-jump-end).\nAs a result, the following algorithm does not make explicit reference to start or end.\n\n \nNote: User agents must still differentiate between [jump-start](#valdef-steps-jump-start) and [start](#valdef-steps-start) for\nthe purpose of serialization (see [§ 2.4 Serialization](#serialization)).\n\n \nThe [output progress value](#output-progress-value) is calculated from the [input progress value](#input-progress-value) and [before flag](#before-flag) as follows:\n\n \n\n \n \nCalculate the current step as `floor([input progress value](#input-progress-value) × [steps](#steps))`.\n\n \n \nIf the [step position](#step-position) property is one of:\n\n \n\n \n \n[jump-start](#valdef-steps-jump-start),\n\n \n \n[jump-both](#valdef-steps-jump-both),\n\n \n\n \nincrement current step by one.\n\n \n \nIf both of the following conditions are true:\n\n \n\n \n \nthe [before flag](#before-flag) is set, and\n\n \n \n[input progress value](#input-progress-value) × [steps](#steps) mod 1 equals zero\n (that is, if input progress value × steps is\n integral), then\n\n \n\n \ndecrement current step by one.\n\n \n \nIf [input progress value](#input-progress-value) ≥ 0 and current step < 0,\n let current step be zero.\n\n \n \nCalculate jumps based on the [step position](#step-position) as follows:\n\n \n [jump-start](#valdef-steps-jump-start) or [jump-end](#valdef-steps-jump-end)\n \n \n[steps](#steps)\n\n [jump-none](#valdef-steps-jump-none)\n \n \n[steps](#steps) - 1\n\n [jump-both](#valdef-steps-jump-both)\n \n \n[steps](#steps) + 1\n\n \n \n \nIf [input progress value](#input-progress-value) ≤ 1 and current step > jumps, let current step be jumps.\n\n \n \nSteps 4 and 6 in this procedure ensure that given an [input progress\n value](#input-progress-value) in the range [0, 1], a step easing function does not produce an [output progress value](#output-progress-value) outside that range.\n\n \nFor example, although mathematically we might expect that a step easing\n function with a [step position](#step-position) of [jump-start](#valdef-steps-jump-start) would step up (i.e. beyond 1) when the [input progress value](#input-progress-value) is 1,\n intuitively,\n when we apply such an easing function to a forwards-filling animation,\n we expect it to produce an [output progress value](#output-progress-value) of 1\n as the animation fills forwards.\n\n \nA similar situation arises for a step easing function with\n a [step position](#step-position) of [jump-end](#valdef-steps-jump-end) when applied to an animation during its delay phase.\n\n \n \n \nThe [output progress value](#output-progress-value) is current step / jumps.\n\n \n\n 2.4. Serialization[](#serialization)\n \nEasing functions are serialized using the common serialization patterns\ndefined in [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) with the following additional requirements:\n\n \n\n \n \nThe keyword values [ease](#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease), [linear](#valdef-easing-function-linear), [ease-in](#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-in), [ease-out](#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-out),\nand [ease-in-out](#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-in-out) are serialized as-is, that is, they are not converted to the equivalent [cubic-bezier()](#funcdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-cubic-bezier) function before serializing.\n\n \n \nStep easing functions, whether they are specified using the [steps()](#funcdef-step-easing-function-steps) function or either of the [step-start](#valdef-step-easing-function-step-start) or [step-end](#valdef-step-easing-function-step-end) keywords, are serialized as follows:\n\n \n\n \n \nIf the [step position](#step-position) is [jump-end](#valdef-steps-jump-end) or [end](#valdef-steps-end), serialize\n as [steps(<integer>)](#funcdef-step-easing-function-steps).\n\n \n \nOtherwise, serialize as [steps(<integer>, <step-position>)](#funcdef-step-easing-function-steps).",
