      "heading": "2.  Value Definition Syntax",
      "content": "The **value definition syntax** described here\n is used to define the set of valid values for CSS properties\n (and the valid syntax of many other parts of CSS).\n A value so described can have one or more components.\n\n 2.1. Component Value Types[](#component-types)\n \nComponent value types are designated in several ways:\n\n \n\n \n \n[Keyword](#keywords) values (such as auto, [disc](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#disc), etc.),\nwhich appear literally, without quotes (e.g. auto).\n\n \n \nBasic data types,\nwhich appear between < and > (e.g., [<length>](#length-value), [<percentage>](#percentage-value), etc.).\nFor [numeric data types](#numeric-data-types),\nthis type notation can annotate any range restrictions\nusing the [bracketed range notation](#numeric-ranges) described below.\n\n \n \nProperty value ranges,\nwhich represent the same pattern of values as a property bearing the same name.\nThese are written as the property name,\nsurrounded by single quotes,\nbetween < and >,\ne.g., [<'border-width'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-width), [<'background-attachment'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-attachment), etc.\n\n \nThese types do not include [CSS-wide keywords](#common-keywords) such as [inherit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#valdef-all-inherit).\nAdditionally,\nif the property’s value grammar\nis a [comma-separated repetition](#mult-comma),\nthe corresponding type\ndoes not include the top-level comma-separated list multiplier.\n(E.g. if a property named pairing is defined as [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ]#,\nthen <'pairing'> is equivalent to [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ],\nnot [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ]#.)\\\n\n \n Why remove the multiplier?\n \nThe top-level multiplier is ripped out of these value types\n because top-level comma-separated repetitions are mostly used for [coordinating list properties](#coordinating-list-property),\n and when a shorthand combines several such properties,\n it needs the unmultiplied grammar\n so it can construct its own comma-separated repetition.\n\n \nWithout this special treatment,\n every such longhand would have to be defined\n with an ad-hoc production just for the inner value,\n which makes the grammars harder to understand overall.\n\n \n \n \nFunctional notations and their arguments.\nThese are written as the function’s name,\nfollowed by an empty parentheses pair,\nbetween < and >,\ne.g. [<calc()>](#funcdef-calc),\nand references the correspondingly-named [functional notation](#functional-notation).\n\n \n \nOther non-terminals.\nThese are written as the name of the non-terminal\nbetween < and >,\nas in <spacing-limit>.\nNotice the distinction between [<border-width>](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#value-def-border-width) and [<'border-width'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-width):\nthe latter represents the grammar of the border-width property,\nthe former requires an explicit expansion elsewhere.\nThe definition of a non-terminal is typically located near its first appearance in the specification.\n\n \n\n \nSome property value definitions also include the slash (/),\n the comma (,),\n and/or parentheses as literals.\n These represent their corresponding tokens.\n Other non-keyword literal characters that may appear in a component value,\n such as “+”,\n must be written enclosed in single quotes.\n\n \n**Commas** specified in the grammar are implicitly omissible in some circumstances,\n when used to separate optional terms in the grammar.\n Within a top-level list in a property or other CSS value,\n or a function’s argument list,\n a comma specified in the grammar must be omitted if:\n\n \n\n all items preceding the comma have been omitted \n all items following the comma have been omitted \n multiple commas would be adjacent (ignoring [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace)/comments),\n due to the items between the commas being omitted. \n \n\n \n [](#example-c02dd41d) For example, if a function can accept three arguments in order,\n but all of them are optional,\n the grammar can be written like: \n\n```\nexample( first[?](#mult-opt) [,](#comb-comma) second[?](#mult-opt) [,](#comb-comma) third[?](#mult-opt) )\n\n```\n\n \nGiven this grammar,\n writing example(first, second, third) is valid,\n as is example(first, second) or example(first, third) or example(second).\n However, example(first, , third) is invalid, as one of those commas are no longer separating two options;\n similarly, example(,second) and example(first,) are invalid. example(first second) is also invalid,\n as commas are still required to actually separate the options.\n\n \nIf commas were not implicitly omittable,\n the grammar would have to be much more complicated\n to properly express the ways that the arguments can be omitted,\n greatly obscuring the simplicity of the feature.\n\n \n \nAll CSS properties also accept the [CSS-wide keyword values](#common-keywords) as the sole component of their property value.\n For readability these are not listed explicitly in the property value syntax definitions.\n For example, the full value definition of [border-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-color) under [CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3](#biblio-css-cascade-3) is <color>{1,4} | inherit | initial | unset (even though it is listed as <color>{1,4}).\n\n \nNote: This implies that, in general,\n combining these keywords with other component values in the same declaration\n results in an invalid declaration.\n For example, [background: url(corner.png) no-repeat, inherit;](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background) is invalid.\n\n 2.2. Component Value Combinators[](#component-combinators)\n \nComponent values can be arranged into property values as follows:\n\n \n\n Juxtaposing components means that\n all of them must occur, in the given order. \n A double ampersand (**&&**) separates two or more components,\n all of which must occur, in any order. \n A double bar (**||**) separates two or more options:\n one or more of them must occur, in any order. \n A bar (**|**) separates two or more alternatives:\n exactly one of them must occur. \n Brackets ([ ]) are for grouping. \n \n\n \nJuxtaposition is stronger than the double ampersand, the double\n ampersand is stronger than the double bar, and the double bar\n is stronger than the bar. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:\n\n```\n a b | c || d && e f\n[ a b ] | [ c || [ d && [ e f ]]]\n\n```\n\n \nFor reorderable combinators (||, &&),\n ordering of the grammar does not matter:\n components in the same grouping may be interleaved in any order.\n Thus, the following lines are equivalent:\n\n```\na || b || c\nb || a || c\n\n```\n\n \nNote: Combinators are not associative, so grouping is significant.\n For example, a || b || c and a || [ b || c ] are distinct grammars:\n the first allows a value like b a c, but the second does not.\n\n 2.3. Component Value Multipliers[](#component-multipliers)\n \nEvery type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of\n the following modifiers:\n\n \n\n An asterisk (*****)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs zero or more times. \n A plus (**+**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs one or more times. \n A question mark (**?**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n is optional (occurs zero or one times). \n A single number in curly braces ({A})\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs A times. \n A comma-separated pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B})\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs at least A and at most B times.\n The B may be omitted ({A,})\n to indicate that there must be at least A repetitions,\n with no upper bound on the number of repetitions. \n A hash mark (**#**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs one or more times, separated by comma tokens\n (which may optionally be surrounded by [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) and/or comments).\n It may optionally be followed by the curly brace forms, above,\n to indicate precisely how many times the repetition occurs,\n like <length>#{1,4}. \n An exclamation point (**!**) after a group\n indicates that the group is required\n and must produce at least one value;\n even if the grammar of the items within the group\n would otherwise allow the entire contents to be omitted,\n at least one component value must not be omitted. \n \n\n \nThe + and # multipliers may be stacked as +#;\n similarly, the # and ? multipliers may be stacked as #?.\n These stacks each represent the later multiplier\n applied to the result of the earlier multiplier.\n (These same stacks can be represented using grouping,\n but in complex grammars this can push the number of brackets beyond readability.)\n\n \nFor repeated component values (indicated by *, +, or #), [UAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) must support at least 20 repetitions of the component.\n If a property value contains more than the supported number of repetitions,\n the declaration must be ignored as if it were invalid.\n\n 2.4. Combinator and Multiplier Patterns[](#combinator-multiplier-patterns)\n \nThere are a small set of common ways to combine multiple independent [component values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#component-value) in particular numbers and orders.\n In particular, it’s common to want to express that,\n from a set of component value,\n the author must select zero or more, one or more, or all of them,\n and in either the order specified in the grammar or in any order.\n\n \nAll of these can be easily expressed using simple patterns of [combinators](#component-combinators) and [multipliers](#component-multipliers):\n\n \n \n \n \n in order \n any order \n \n \n zero or more \n A? B? C? \n A? || B? || C? \n \n one or more \n [ A? B? C? ]! \n A || B || C \n \n all \n A B C \n A && B && C \n \n \nNote that all of the \"any order\" possibilities are expressed using combinators,\n while the \"in order\" possibilities are all variants on juxtaposition.\n\n 2.5. Component Values and White Space[](#component-whitespace)\n \nUnless otherwise specified, [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) and/or comments may appear before, after, and/or between\n components combined using the above [combinators](#component-combinators) and [multipliers](#component-multipliers).\n\n \nNote: In many cases, spaces will in fact be required between components\n in order to distinguish them from each other.\n For example, the value 1em2em would be parsed as a single [<dimension-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-dimension-token) with the number 1 and the identifier em2em,\n which is an invalid unit.\n In this case, a space would be required before the 2 to get this parsed as the two lengths 1em and 2em.\n\n 2.6. Functional Notation Definitions[](#component-functions)\n \nThe syntax of a [functional notation](#functional-notation) is defined\n as a sequence of:\n\n \n\n \n \nThe function’s name written as an identifier\nfollowed by an open parenthesis\n(such as example(),\nor the [<function-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-function-token) production\nto indicate a function with an arbitrary name.\n\n \n \nThe function’s arguments, if any,\nexpressed using the [value definition syntax](#css-value-definition-syntax).\n\n \n \nA literal closing parenthesis.\n\n \n\n \nThe function’s arguments are considered implicitly grouped,\n as if surrounded by brackets ([ ... ]).\n\n \n [](#example-0cdbfbca) For example, a grammar like: \n\n```\nexample( <length> [,](#comb-comma) <length> )\n\n```\n\n \nwill match a function whose name is \"example\"\n and whose arguments match \"[<length>](#length-value) , <length>\".\n\n \n \n [](#example-99e5c2a2) For example, the Selectors grammar defines pseudo-classes generically,\n allowing any possibly function name after the initial colon: \n\n```\n<pseudo-class-selector> = ':' <ident-token> [|](#comb-one) ':' <function-token> <any-value> ')'\n\n```\n\n \nThis represents any function name,\n with [<any-value>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-any-value) as the function arguments.\n\n \n [](#example-885ed9bc) Since the [functional notation](#functional-notation) implicitly groups its contents,\n the effect of any combinator inside it\n is scoped to the function’s argument.\n For example, the functional notation syntax definition example( foo | bar ) is equivalent to example( [ foo | bar ] ). \n 2.7.

Non-Terminal Definitions and Grammar Production Blocks[](#production-blocks)\n \nThe precise grammar of non-terminals, like [<position>](#typedef-position) or [<calc()>](#funcdef-calc),\n is often specified in a **CSS grammar production block**.\n These are conventionally represented in a preformatted block of definitions\n like this:\n\n \n [](#example-b4765280) The <foo> syntax is defined as follows: \n\n```\n<foo> = keyword [|](#comb-one) <bar> [|](#comb-one)\n some-really-long-pattern-of-stuff\n<bar> = <length>\n\n```\n\n \n \nEach definition starts on its own line,\n and consists of the non-terminal to be defined,\n followed by an =,\n followed by the fragment of [value definition syntax](#css-value-definition-syntax) to which it expands.\n A definition can stretch across multiple lines,\n and terminates before the next line that starts a new grammar production\n or at the end of the grammar production block\n (whichever comes first).\n\n [](#example-3cb12b0e) In the above example, the <foo> definition covers two lines.\n The third line starts a new definition for <bar>.\n (A naked = is never valid in [value definition syntax](#css-value-definition-syntax),\n so it’s unambiguous when a new line starts a fresh definition.)",

      "content": "Some procedures, for example [transitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions/) and [animations](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations/), **combine** two CSS property values.\n The following combining operations—​on the two [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) VA and VB yielding the computed value Vresult—​are defined.\n For operations that are not commutative\n (for example, matrix multiplication,\n or accumulation of mismatched transform lists) VA represents\n the first term of the operation and VB represents\n the second.\n\n \n **interpolation** \n \n Given two property values VA and VB,\n produces an intermediate value Vresult at a distance of p along the interval between VA and VB such that p = 0 produces VA and p = 1 produces VB. \n \nThe range of p is (−∞, ∞)\n due to the effect of [timing functions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#easing-function).\n As a result, this procedure must also define\n extrapolation behavior for p outside [0, 1].\n\n **addition** \n \n Given two property values VA and VB,\n returns the sum of the two properties, Vresult. \n \nNote: While [addition](#addition) can often be expressed\n in terms of the same weighted sum function\n used to define [interpolation](#interpolation),\n this is not always the case.\n For example, interpolation of transform matrices involves\n decomposing and interpolating the matrix components\n whilst addition relies on matrix multiplication.\n\n \nIf a value type does not define a specific procedure for [addition](#addition) or is defined as **not additive**,\n its addition operation is simply Vresult = VB.\n\n **accumulation** \n \n Given two property values VA and VB,\n returns the result, Vresult,\n of combining the two operands\n such that VB is treated as a delta from VA. \n \n Note: For many types of animation such as numbers or lengths, [accumulation](#accumulation) is defined to be identical\n to [addition](#addition). \n \nA common case where the definitions differ\n is for list-based types\n where [addition](#addition) may be defined as appending to a list\n whilst [accumulation](#accumulation) may be defined\n as component-based addition.\n For example, the filter list values blur(2) and blur(3),\n when added together would produce blur(2) blur(3),\n but when accumulated would produce blur(5).\n\n \n \nIf a value type does not define a specific procedure for [accumulation](#accumulation),\n its accumulation operation is identical to [addition](#addition).\n\n \n \nThese operations are only defined on [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value).\n (As a result, it is not necessary to define, for example,\n how to add a [<length>](#length-value) value of 15pt with 5em since such values will be resolved to their [canonical unit](#canonical-unit) before being passed to any of the above procedures.)\n\n 3.1. Range Checking[](#combining-range)\n \nInterpolation can result in a value outside the valid range for a property,\n even if all of the inputs to interpolation are valid;\n this especially happens when p is outside the [0, 1] range,\n but some [easing functions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#easing-function) can cause this to occur even within that range.\n If the final result after interpolation, addition, and accumulation\n is out-of-range for the target context the value is being used in,\n it does not cause the declaration to be invalid.\n Instead, the value must be clamped to the range allowed in the target context,\n exactly the same as [math functions](#math-function) (see [§ 10.12 Range Checking](#calc-range)).\n\n \nNote: Even if interpolation results in an out-of-range value,\n addition/accumulation might \"correct\" the result and bring it back into range.\n Thus, clamping is only applied to the final result\n of applying all interpolation-related operations.",

[ease-in](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-in) is claimed by the [<easing-function>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#typedef-easing-function) production belonging to animation-timing-function,\n leaving [ease-out](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-out) to be claimed by the [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) production belonging to [animation-name](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation-name). \n \nNote: When designing grammars with [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value),\n the <custom-ident> should always be “positionally unambiguous”,\n so that it’s impossible to conflict with any keyword values in the property.\n Such conflicts can alternatively be avoided by using [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident).\n\n 4.3. Prefixed Author-defined Identifiers: the [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident) type[](#dashed-idents)\n \nSome contexts accept both author-defined identifiers and CSS-defined identifiers.\n If not handled carefully,\n this can result in difficulties adding new CSS-defined values; [UAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) have to study existing usage\n and gamble that there are sufficiently few author-defined identifiers in use\n matching the new CSS-defined one,\n so giving the new value a special CSS-defined meaning\n won’t break existing pages.\n\n \nWhile there are many legacy cases in CSS\n that mix these two values spaces in exactly this fraught way,\n the [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident) type is meant to be an easy way\n to distinguish author-defined identifiers\n from CSS-defined identifiers.\n\n \nThe **[<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident)** production\n is a [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value),\n with all the case-sensitivity that implies,\n with the additional restriction that it must start with two dashes\n (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS).\n\n \n[<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident)s are reserved solely for use as author-defined names.\n CSS will never define a <dashed-ident> for its own use.\n\n \n [](#example-a91b3e3f) For example, [custom properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#custom-property) need to be distinguishable from CSS-defined properties,\n as new properties are added to CSS regularly.\n To allow this, custom property names are required to be [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident)s,\n as in this example: \n\n```\n.foo {\n --fg-color: blue;\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-340c7d34) [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident)s are also used in the [@color-profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#at-ruledef-profile) rule,\n to separate author-defined color profiles\n from pre-defined ones like device-cmyk,\n and allow CSS to define more pre-defined (but overridable) profiles in the future\n without fear of clashing with author-defined profiles: \n\n```\n@color-profile --foo { src: url(https://example.com/foo.icc); }\n.foo {\n color: color(--foo 1 0 .5 / .2);\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-32974307) CSS will use [<dashed-ident>](#typedef-dashed-ident) more in the future,\n as more author-controlled syntax is added.\n CSS authoring tools,\n such as preprocessors that turn custom syntax into standard CSS, should use <dashed-ident> as well,\n to avoid clashing with future CSS design. \n \nFor example,\n if a CSS preprocessor added a new \"custom\" at-rule,\n it shouldn’t spell it @custom,\n as this would clash with a future official @custom rule added by CSS.\n Instead, it should use @--custom,\n which is guaranteed to never clash with anything defined by CSS.\n\n \nEven better, it should use @--library1-custom,\n so that if Library2 adds their own \"custom\" at-rule\n (spelled @--library2-custom),\n there’s no possibility of clash.\n Ideally this prefix should be customizable,\n if allowed by the tooling,\n so authors can manually avoid clashes on their own.\n\n \n 4.4. Quoted Strings: the [<string>](#string-value) type[](#strings)\n \n[Strings](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string) are denoted by **<string>**.\n When written literally,\n they consist of a sequence of characters delimited by double quotes or single quotes,\n corresponding to the [<string-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-string-token) production\n in the [CSS Syntax Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n\n \n [](#example-9204e1e4) Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, unless [escaped](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#escaped-characters) (as \"\\\"\" or as \"\\22\").\n Analogously for single quotes ('\\'' or '\\27'). \n\n```\ncontent: \"this is a 'string'.\";\ncontent: \"this is a \\\"string\\\".\";\ncontent: 'this is a \"string\".';\ncontent: 'this is a \\'string\\'.'\n\n```\n\n \n \nIt is possible to break strings over several lines, for aesthetic or\n other reasons, but in such a case the newline itself has to be escaped\n with a backslash (\\). The newline is subsequently removed from the\n string. For instance, the following two selectors are exactly the\n same:\n\n \n [](#example-4f7429ed) \n \nExample(s): \n\n```\na[title=\"a not s\\\no very long title\"] {/*...*/}\na[title=\"a not so very long title\"] {/*...*/}\n\n```\n\n \n \nSince a string cannot directly represent a newline, to include a\n newline in a string, use the escape \"\\A\". (Hexadecimal A is the line\n feed character in Unicode (U+000A), but represents the generic notion\n of \"newline\" in CSS.)\n\n 4.5. Resource Locators: the [<url>](#url-value) type[](#urls)\n \nThe [<url>](#url-value) type,\n written with the **url()** and **src()** functions,\n represents a [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url),\n which is a pointer to a resource.\n\n \nThe syntax of [<url>](#url-value) is:\n\n```\n**<url>** = [<url()>](#funcdef-url) [|](#comb-one) [<src()>](#funcdef-src)\n\n<url()> = url( [<string>](#string-value) [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)[*](#mult-zero-plus) ) [|](#comb-one) [<url-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-url-token)\n<src()> = src( [<string>](#string-value) [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)[*](#mult-zero-plus) )\n\n```\n\n \n [](#example-1dcaf1ec) This example shows a URL being used as a background image: \n\n```\nbody { background: url(\"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\") }\n\n```\n\n \n \nFor legacy reasons, a [url()](#funcdef-url) can be written without quotation marks around the URL itself,\n in which case it is [specially-parsed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-a-url-token) as a [<url-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-url-token) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n Because of this special parsing, url() is only able to specify its URL literally; [src()](#funcdef-src) lacks this special parsing rule,\n and so its URL can be provided by functions,\n such as [var()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var).\n\n \n [](#example-a2ee15a6) For example, the following declarations are identical: \n\n```\nbackground: url(\"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\");\nbackground: url(http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif);\n\n```\n\n \nAnd these have the same meaning as well:\n\n```\nbackground: src(\"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\");\n--foo: \"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\";\nbackground: src(var(--foo));\n\n```\n\n \nBut this does not work:\n\n```\n--foo: \"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\";\nbackground: url(var(--foo));\n\n```\n\n \n...because the unescaped \"(\" in the value causes a parse error,\n so the entire declaration is thrown out as invalid.\n\n \n \n The unquoted [url()](#funcdef-url) syntax cannot accept a [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier) argument\n and has extra escaping requirements:\n parentheses, [whitespace](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) characters,\n single quotes (') and double quotes (\") appearing in a URL\n must be escaped with a backslash,\n e.g. url(open\\(parens), url(close\\)parens).\n (In quoted [<string>](#string-value) url()s,\n only newlines and the character used to quote the string need to be escaped.)\n Depending on the type of URL,\n it might also be possible to write these characters as URL-escapes\n (e.g. url(open%28parens) or url(close%29parens))\n as described in [[URL]](#biblio-url). \n \nThe precise requirements for parsing the unquoted [url()](#funcdef-url) syntax\n are normatively defined in [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n\n \n \nSome CSS contexts (such as [@import](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#at-ruledef-import)) also allow a [<url>](#url-value) to be represented by a bare [<string>](#string-value), without the function wrapper.\n In such cases the string behaves identically to a [url()](#funcdef-url) function containing that string.\n\n \n [](#example-ae720903) For example, the following statements act identically: \n\n```\n@import url(\"base-theme.css\");\n@import \"base-theme.css\";\n\n```\n\n \n 4.5.1. Relative URLs[](#relative-urls)\n \nIn order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on\n the absolute location of a resource, authors should use relative URLs.\n Relative URLs (as defined in [[URL]](#biblio-url)) are resolved to full URLs\n using a base URL. RFC 3986, section 3, defines the normative\n algorithm for this process.\n For CSS style sheets, the base URL is that of the style sheet itself,\n not that of the styled source document.\n Style sheets embedded within a document have\n the base URL associated with their container.\n\n \nNote: For HTML documents,\n the [base URL is mutable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls).\n\n \nWhen a [<url>](#url-value) appears in the computed value of a property,\n it is resolved to an absolute URL,\n as described in the preceding paragraph.\n The computed value of a URL that the [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) cannot resolve to an absolute URL is the specified value.\n\n \n [](#example-b514611a) For example, suppose the following rule: \n\n```\nbody { background: url(\"tile.png\") }\n```\n\n \nis located in a style sheet designated by the URL:\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.org/style/basic.css\n```\n\n \nThe background of the source document’s <body> will be tiled with whatever image is described by the resource designated by the URL:\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.org/style/tile.png\n```\n\n \nThe same image will be used regardless of the URL of the source document containing the <body>.\n\n \n 4.5.1.1. Fragment URLs[](#local-urls)\n \nTo enable element ID references to work in CSS\n regardless of base URL changes\n or shadow DOM, [<url>](#url-value)s have special behavior\n when they contain only a fragment.\n\n \nIf a [<url>](#url-value)’s value starts with a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#) character,\n then the URL additionally has its **\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\" data-export id=\"url-local-url-flag\">local url flag** set,\n and is a [tree-scoped reference](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#css-tree-scoped-reference) for the URL’s [fragment](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-fragment).\n\n \nWhen matching a [<url>](#url-value) with the [local url flag](#url-local-url-flag) set:\n\n \n\n \n \nif the URL’s fragment is an element ID reference\n(rather than, say, a media fragment),\nresolve it as a [tree-scoped reference](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#css-tree-scoped-reference) with the tree’s IDs as the associated [tree-scoped names](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#css-tree-scoped-name):\nspecifically, resolve to the first element\nin [tree order](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order) among the associated [node tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-tree)'s descendants\nwith the URL’s [fragment](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-fragment) as its ID.\n(And, as usual for tree-scoped references,\ncontinuing up to the host’s tree if needed.)\n\n \nIf no such element is found,\nthe URL fails to resolve.\n\n \n \notherwise, resolve the fragment against the current document.\n\n \n\n \n[](#issue-f83e4845) Possibly reference [find a potential indicated element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#find-a-potential-indicated-element),\n but that is defined specifically for [Document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document)s,\n not [ShadowRoot](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadowroot)s.\n\n \nNote: This means that such fragments will resolve\n against the contents of the current document\n (or whichever [node tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-tree) the stylesheet lives in,\n if shadow DOM is involved)\n regardless of how such relative URLs would resolve elsewhere\n (ignoring, for example, [base](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-base-element) elements\n changing the base URL,\n or relative URLs in linked stylesheets\n resolving against the stylesheet’s URL).\n\n \n [](#example-08e9b99a) In the following example, #anchor will resolve against http://example.com/ whereas #image will resolve against the elements in the HTML document itself: \n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<base href=\"http://example.com/\">\n...\n<a href=\"#anchor\" style=\"background-image: url(#image)\">link</a>\n\n```\n\n \n \nWhen [serializing](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values) a [url()](#funcdef-url) with the [local url flag](#url-local-url-flag) set,\n it must serialize as just the fragment.\n\n 4.5.2. Empty URLs[](#url-empty)\n \nIf the value of the [<url>](#url-value) is the empty string\n (like url(\"\") or [url()](#funcdef-url)),\n the url must resolve to an invalid resource\n (similar to what the url about:invalid does).\n\n \nIts computed value is url(\"\") or src(\"\"),\n whichever was specified,\n and it must serialize as such.\n\n \nNote: This matches the behavior of empty urls for embedded resources elsewhere in the web platform,\n and avoids excess traffic re-requesting the stylesheet or host document\n due to editing mistakes leaving the [url()](#funcdef-url) value empty,\n which are almost certain to be invalid resources for whatever the url() shows up in.\n Linking on the web platform does allow empty urls,\n so if/when CSS gains some functionality to control hyperlinks,\n this restriction can be relaxed in those contexts.\n\n 4.5.3. URL Modifiers[](#url-modifiers)\n \n[<url>](#url-value)s support specifying additional **<url-modifier>**s,\n which change the meaning or the interpretation of the URL somehow.\n A [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier) is either an [<ident>](#typedef-ident) or a [functional notation](#functional-notation).\n\n \nThis specification does not define any [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)s,\n but other specs may do so.\n\n \nNote: A [<url>](#url-value) that is either unquoted or not wrapped in [url()](#funcdef-url) notation\n cannot accept any [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)s.\n\n 4.5.4. URL Processing Model[](#url-processing)\n \n To **fetch a style resource** from a [url](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) or [<url>](#url-value) urlValue,\n given a [CSSStyleSheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#cssstylesheet) sheet,\n a string destination matching a [RequestDestination](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requestdestination),\n a \"no-cors\" or \"cors\" corsMode,\n and an algorithm processResponse accepting a [response](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response) and a null, failure or byte stream: \n \n\n \n \nLet environmentSettings be sheet’s [relevant settings object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#relevant-settings-object).\n\n \n \nLet base be sheet’s [stylesheet base URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#concept-css-style-sheet-stylesheet-base-url) if it is not null,\notherwise environmentSettings’s [API base URL](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#api-base-url). [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom)\n\n \n \nLet parsedUrl be the result of the [URL parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser) steps\nwith urlValue’s [url](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) and base.\nIf the algorithm returns an error, return.\n\n \n \nLet req be a new [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) whose [url](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url) is parsedUrl,\nwhose [destination](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination) is destination, [mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode) is corsMode, [origin](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-origin) is environmentSettings’s [origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#concept-settings-object-origin), [credentials mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode) is \"same-origin\", [use-url-credentials flag](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-use-url-credentials-flag) is set, [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client) is environmentSettings,\nand whose [referrer](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-referrer) is environmentSettings’s [API base URL](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#api-base-url).\n\n \n \nApply any **URL request modifier steps** that apply to this request.\n\n \nNote: This specification does not define any URL request modification steps,\nbut other specs may do so.\n\n \n \nIf req’s [mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode) is \"cors\",\nset req’s [referrer](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-referrer) to sheet’s [location](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#concept-css-style-sheet-location). [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom)\n\n \n \nIf sheet’s [origin-clean flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag) is set,\nset req’s [initiator type](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-initiator-type) to \"css\". [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom)\n\n \n \n[Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch) req,\nwith [processresponseconsumebody](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#process-response-end-of-body) set to processResponse.\n\n \n\n \n \nWhen interpreting [URLs](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) expressed in CSS,\n the [URL parser’s](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser) encoding argument\n must be omitted\n (i.e. use the default, UTF-8),\n regardless of the stylesheet encoding.\n\n \nNote: In other words, a URL written in CSS\n will always [percent-encode](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#string-percent-encode-after-encoding) non-ASCII codepoints\n using UTF-8 in the [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) object\n (and thus whenever using the URL value for e.g. network requests),\n regardless of the stylesheet’s own encoding.\n Note that this occurs [after decoding the stylesheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#input-byte-stream) into Unicode [code points](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-point).",

      "content": "Numeric data types are used to represent\n quantities, indexes, positions, and other such values.\n Although many syntactic variations can exist\n in expressing the quantity (numeric aspect) in a given numeric value,\n the [specified](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value) and [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) do not distinguish these variations:\n they represent the value’s abstract quantity,\n not its syntactic representation.\n\n \nThe **numeric data types** include [<integer>](#integer-value), [<number>](#number-value), [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n and various [dimensions](#dimension) including [<length>](#length-value), [<angle>](#angle-value), [<time>](#time-value), [<frequency>](#frequency-value), and [<resolution>](#resolution-value).\n\n \nNote: While general-purpose [dimensions](#dimension) are defined here,\n some other modules define additional data types\n (e.g. [[css-grid-1]](#biblio-css-grid-1) introduces [fr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#valdef-flex-fr) units)\n whose usage is more localized.\n\n \nThe precision and supported range of numeric values in CSS\n is [implementation-defined](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#implementation-defined),\n and can vary based on the property or other context a value is used in.\n However, within the CSS specifications,\n infinite precision and range is assumed.\n When a value cannot be explicitly supported due to range/precision limitations,\n it must be converted to the closest value supported by the implementation,\n but how the implementation defines \"closest\" is implementation-defined as well.\n\n \nIf an [<angle>](#angle-value) must be converted\n due to exceeding the implementation-defined range of supported values,\n it must be clamped to the nearest supported multiple of 360deg.\n\n 5.1. Range Restrictions and Range Definition Notation[](#numeric-ranges)\n \nProperties can restrict numeric values to some range.\n If the value is outside the allowed range,\n then unless otherwise specified,\n the declaration is invalid and must be [ignored](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore).\n Range restrictions can be annotated in the numeric type notation\n using **CSS bracketed range notation**—​[min,max]—​within the angle brackets, after the identifying keyword,\n indicating a closed range\n between (and including) min and max.\n For example, [<integer [0,10]>](#integer-value) indicates an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive,\n while [<angle [0,180deg]>](#angle-value) indicates an angle between 0deg and 180deg (expressed in any unit).\n\n \nNote: CSS values generally do not allow open ranges;\n thus only square-bracket notation is used.\n\n \nCSS theoretically supports infinite precision and infinite ranges for all value types;\n however in reality implementations have finite capacity. [UAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) should support reasonably useful ranges and precisions.\n Range extremes that are ideally unlimited\n are indicated using ∞ or −∞ as appropriate.\n For example, [<length [0,∞]>](#length-value) indicates a non-negative length.\n\n \nIf no range is indicated,\n either by using the [bracketed range notation](#css-bracketed-range-notation) or in the property description,\n then [−∞,∞] is assumed.\n\n \nValues of −∞ or ∞ must be written without units,\n even if the value type uses units.\n Values of 0 can be written without units,\n even if the value type doesn’t allow “unitless zeroes”\n (such as [<time>](#time-value)).\n\n \nNote: At the time of writing,\n the [bracketed range notation](#css-bracketed-range-notation) is new;\n thus in most CSS specifications\n any range limitations are described only in prose.\n (For example, “Negative values are not allowed” or\n “Negative values are invalid”\n indicate a [0,∞] range.)\n This does not make them any less binding.\n\n 5.2.

Ratios: the [<ratio>](#ratio-value) type[](#ratios)\n \nRatio values are denoted by **<ratio>**,\n and represent the ratio of two numeric values.\n It most often represents an aspect ratio,\n relating a width (first) to a height (second).\n\n \nWhen written literally,\n a **ratio** has the syntax:\n\n```\n[<ratio>](#ratio-value) = [<number [0,∞]>](#number-value) [ / [<number [0,∞]>](#number-value) ][?](#mult-opt)\n\n```\n\n \nThe second [<number>](#number-value) is optional,\n defaulting to 1.\n However, [<ratio>](#ratio-value) is always serialized with both components.\n\n \nThe computed value of a [<ratio>](#ratio-value) is the pair of numbers provided.\n\n \nIf either number in the [<ratio>](#ratio-value) is 0 or infinite,\n it represents a **degenerate ratio** (and, generally, won’t do anything).\n\n \nIf two [<ratio>](#ratio-value)s need to be compared,\n divide the first number by the second,\n and compare the results.\n For example, 3/2 is less than 2/1,\n because it resolves to 1.5 while the second resolves to 2.\n (In other words, “tall” aspect ratios are less than “wide” aspect ratios.)\n\n 5.7.1. Combination of [<ratio>](#ratio-value)[](#combine-ratio)\n \nThe interpolation of a [<ratio>](#ratio-value) is defined\n by converting each <ratio> to a number\n by dividing the first value by the second\n (so a ratio of 3 / 2 would become 1.5),\n taking the logarithm of that result\n (so the 1.5 would become approximately 0.176),\n then interpolating those values.\n The result during the interpolation\n is converted back to a <ratio> by inverting the logarithm,\n then interpreting the result as a <ratio> with the result as the first value and 1 as the second value.\n\n \nIf either [<ratio>](#ratio-value) is [degenerate](#degenerate-ratio),\n the values cannot be interpolated.\n\n \n [](#example-c4a376f3) For example,\n halfway through a linear interpolation from 5 / 1 to 3 / 2,\n the result is approximately the ratio 2.73 / 1 (roughly 11 / 4, slightly taller than a 3 / 1 ratio): \n\n```\nstart = log(5); // ≈ 0.69897\nend = log(1.5); // ≈ 0.17609\ninterp = 0.69897*.5 + 0.17609*.5; // ≈ 0.43753\nfinal = 10^interp; // ≈ 2.73\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: Interpolating over the logarithm of the ratio\n means the results are scale-independent\n (5 / 1 to 300 / 200 would give the same results as above),\n that they’re symmetrical over \"wide\" and \"tall\" variants\n (interpolating from 1 / 5 to 2 / 3 would give\n a ratio approximately equal to 1 / 2.73 at the halfway point),\n and that they’re symmetrical over whether the width is fixed and the height is based on the ratio\n or vice versa.\n These properties are not shared by many other possible interpolation strategies.\n\n \nNote: Due to the properties of logarithms,\n any log can be used;\n the example here uses base-10 log,\n but if, say, the natural log and e was used,\n the intermediate results would be different\n but the final result would be the same.\n\n \nAddition of [<ratio>](#ratio-value)s is not possible.",

line-height.)\n\n \nWhen used outside the context of an element\n (such as in [media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#media-query)),\n the [font-relative lengths](#font-relative-length) units refer to the metrics corresponding\n to the initial values of the [font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font) and [line-height](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-line-height) properties.\n Similarly, when specified in a document with no root element,\n the [root font-relative lengths](#root-font-relative-lengths) are resolved\n assuming the initial values of the font and line-height properties.\n\n \nNote: Font-relative units such as [ch](#ch) and [ic](#ic) can trigger font downloads,\n if a required font is not yet loaded.\n\n \nThe [font-relative lengths](#font-relative-length) are calculated in the absence of shaping.\n\n \nSome user-agents allow users to apply additional restrictions to font sizes in a document,\n such as setting minimum font sizes to ensure readability.\n Such restrictions must be applied to the [used value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) of the affected properties only;\n they must not affect the resolution of [font-relative lengths](#font-relative-length) used in properties.\n However, in other contexts\n (such as in [media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#media-query)),\n to the extent that they would impact the used font metrics,\n such restrictions do affect the resolution of font-relative lengths.\n\n \nNote: In general, respecting a user’s preferences, like minimum font sizes,\n is desirable;\n it’s useful for a media query like (min-width: 40em) to use the actual font size the document will be displayed in.\n However, having these preferences affect font-relative lengths in properties on an element was found to not be Web-compatible;\n too many pages expect these units to be exact multiples of the specified [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size),\n rather than the actual font-size after applying user preferences.\n\n \nSome user-agents apply restrictions to the [line-height](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-line-height) values on form controls.\n These must have no effect on the [lh](#lh) and [rlh](#rlh) units.\n The effect on their descendants, however, is [implementation-defined](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#implementation-defined).\n\n 6.1.2. Viewport-percentage Lengths: the *vw, *vh, *vi, *vb, *vmin, *vmax units[](#viewport-relative-lengths)\n \nThe **viewport-percentage lengths** are relative to the size of the [initial containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details)—​which is itself based on the size of either\n the viewport (for [continuous media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#continuous-media))\n or the [page area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/#page-area) (for [paged media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#paged-media)).\n When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed,\n they are scaled accordingly.\n\n 6.1.2.1. The Large, Small, and Dynamic Viewport Sizes[](#viewport-variants)\n \nThere are four variants of the [viewport-percentage length](#viewport-percentage-lengths) units,\n corresponding to three (possibly identical) notions of the viewport size.\n\n \n large viewport \n \n The **large viewport-percentage units** (lv*)\n and **default viewport-percentage units** (v*)\n are defined with respect to the **large viewport size**:\n the viewport sized assuming\n any [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) interfaces that are dynamically expanded and retracted\n to be retracted.\n This allows authors to size content\n such that it is guaranteed to fill the viewport,\n noting that such content might be hidden behind such interfaces\n when they are expanded. \n \nThe sizes of the [large viewport-percentage units](#large-viewport-percentage-units) are fixed\n (and therefore stable) unless the viewport itself is resized.\n\n [](#example-18205b29) For example, on phones,\n where screen real-estate is at a premium,\n browsers will often hide part or all of the title and address bar\n once the user starts scrolling the page.\n The [large viewport-percentage units](#large-viewport-percentage-units) are sized relative to\n this larger everything-retracted space,\n so content using these units will fill the entire visible page\n when these UI elements are hidden.\n However, when these retractable elements are shown,\n they can obscure content\n that is sized or positioned using these units. \n small viewport \n \n The **small viewport-percentage units** (sv*)\n are defined with respect to the **small viewport size**:\n the viewport sized assuming\n any [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) interfaces that are dynamically expanded and retracted\n to be expanded.\n This allows authors to size content\n such that it can fit within the viewport\n even when such interfaces are present,\n noting that such content might not fill the viewport\n when such interfaces are retracted. \n \nThe sizes of the [small viewport-percentage units](#small-viewport-percentage-units) are fixed\n (and therefore stable) unless the viewport itself is resized.\n\n \n [](#example-c1ac496e) An element that is sized as [height: 100svh](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-height), for example,\n will fill the screen perfectly,\n without any of its content being obscured,\n when all the dynamic UI elements of the UA are shown. \n \nOnce those UI elements start being hidden, however,\n there will be extra space around the element.\n The [small viewport-percentage units](#small-viewport-percentage-units) units are thus “safer” in general,\n but might not produce the most attractive layout\n once the user starts interacting with the page.\n\n \n dynamic viewport \n \n The **dynamic viewport-percentage units** (dv*)\n are defined with respect to the **dynamic viewport size**:\n the viewport sized\n with dynamic consideration of any [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) interfaces\n that are dynamically expanded and retracted.\n This allows authors to size content\n such that it can exactly fit within the viewport\n whether or not such interfaces are present. \n \nThe sizes of the [dynamic viewport-percentage units](#dynamic-viewport-percentage-units) are not stable even while the viewport itself is unchanged.\n Using these units can cause content\n to resize e.g. while the user scrolls the page.\n Depending on usage,\n this can be disturbing to the user\n and/or costly in terms of performance.\n\n \nThe UA is not required to animate the [dynamic viewport-percentage units](#dynamic-viewport-percentage-units) while expanding and retracting any relevant interfaces,\n and may instead calculate the units\n as if the relevant interface was fully expanded or retracted\n during the UI animation.\n (It is recommended that UAs assume the fully-retracted size\n for this duration.)\n\n \n \nWhether the expansion/retraction of a particular interface\n (A)\n changes the sizes of all of the [viewport-percentage lengths](#viewport-percentage-lengths) (and the [initial containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#initial-containing-block))\n simultaneously\n or (B)\n contributes to the differences between\n the [large viewport size](#large-viewport-size) and [small viewport size](#small-viewport-size) is largely UA-dependent.\n However:\n\n \n\n \n \nChanges in interface that happen as a result of scrolling\nor other frequent page interactions that would disturb the user\nif they resulted in substantial layout changes\nmust be categorized as the latter (B).\n\n \n \nChanges in interface that have a sufficiently steady state\nthat re-laying out the document into the adjusted space\nwould be beneficial to the user\nmust be categorized as the former (A).\n\n \n \nAdditionally,\nUAs may have some dynamically-shown interfaces\nthat intentionally overlay content\nand do not cause any shifts in layout—​and therefore have no effect on any of the [viewport-percentage lengths](#viewport-percentage-lengths).\n(Typically on-screen keyboards will fit into this category.)\n\n \n\n \nIn all cases,\n if the value of [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-overflow) or [scrollbar-gutter](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-scrollbar-gutter) on the [root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#root-element) in either axis\n would cause scrollbars to appear (or space to be reserved for them) unconditionally\n (for example, overflow: scroll, but not overflow: auto),\n the [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of the [viewport-percentage lengths](#viewport-percentage-lengths) in that axis\n are reduced in accordance with the [initial containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#initial-containing-block).\n Otherwise,\n and always in the case of [media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#media-query),\n the viewport-percentage lengths are sized\n assuming that scrollbars do not exist\n (even if this diverges from the initial containing block).\n\n \nNote: The value of [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-overflow) on [the body element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-body-element-2) can sometimes affect the presence of scrollbars on the [root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#root-element).\n This does not affect the size of viewport units, however.\n\n 6.1.2.2. The Various Viewport-relative Units[](#viewport-relative-units)\n \nThe [viewport-percentage length](#viewport-percentage-lengths) units are:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vw\">vw** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svw\">svw** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvw\">lvw** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvw\">dvw** \n \n Equal to 1% of the width of the [large viewport size](#large-viewport-size), [small viewport size](#small-viewport-size), large viewport size,\n and [dynamic viewport size](#dynamic-viewport-size),\n respectively. \n \n [](#example-6068ee5d) In the example below, if the width of the viewport is 200mm,\n the font size of h1 elements will be 16mm\n (i.e. (8×200mm)/100). \n\n```\nh1 { font-size: 8vw }\n```\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vh\">vh** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svh\">svh** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvh\">lvh** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvh\">dvh** \n Equal to 1% of the height of the [large viewport size](#large-viewport-size), [small viewport size](#small-viewport-size), large viewport size,\n and [dynamic viewport size](#dynamic-viewport-size),\n respectively. \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vi\">vi** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svi\">svi** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvi\">lvi** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvi\">dvi** \n Equal to 1% of the size of the [large viewport size](#large-viewport-size), [small viewport size](#small-viewport-size), large viewport size,\n and [dynamic viewport size](#dynamic-viewport-size) (respectively)\n in the box’s [inline axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-axis). \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vb\">vb** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svb\">svb** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvb\">lvb** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvb\">dvb** \n Equal to 1% of the size of the initial containing block [large viewport size](#large-viewport-size), [small viewport size](#small-viewport-size), large viewport size,\n and [dynamic viewport size](#dynamic-viewport-size) (respectively)\n in the box’s [block axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-axis). \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vmin\">vmin** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svmin\">svmin** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvmin\">lvmin** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvmin\">dvmin** \n Equal to the smaller of *vw or *vh. \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"vmax\">vmax** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"svmax\">svmax** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"lvmax\">lvmax** \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"dvmax\">dvmax** \n Equal to the larger of *vw or *vh. \n \n \nNote: The original (unprefixed) viewport units [were defined](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#viewport-relative-lengths) relative to the [initial containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#initial-containing-block),\n which in [continuous media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#continuous-media) always matched the (singular) viewport size.\n The dynamism of browser chrome shifting in and out during scrolling was invented later,\n and following Safari’s lead, most UAs mapped these units to the larger size.\n Defining it this way is prettier in many cases,\n but can also block critical content (such as toolbars, headers, and footers) in others.\n It’s therefore not entirely clear whether this was the best mapping,\n and thus earlier editions of this specifications\n allowed UAs to choose the mapping of these default units.\n However at this point the mapping to the [large viewport-percentage units](#large-viewport-percentage-units) is presumed to be required for Web compatibility.\n\n \nIn situations where there is no element\n or it hasn’t yet been styled\n (such as when evaluating [media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#media-query)),\n the *vi and *vb units use the initial value of the [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode) property\n to determine which axis they correspond to.\n\n 6.2. Absolute Lengths: the [cm](#cm), [mm](#mm), [Q](#Q), [in](#in), [pt](#pt), [pc](#pc), [px](#px) units[](#absolute-lengths)\n \nThe **absolute length units** are fixed in relation to each other\n and [anchored](#anchor-unit) to some physical measurement.\n They are mainly useful when the output environment is known.\n The absolute units consist of\n the **physical units** ([in](#in), [cm](#cm), [mm](#mm), [pt](#pt), [pc](#pc), [Q](#Q))\n and the **visual angle unit (pixel unit)** ([px](#px)):\n\n \n \n \n unit \n name \n equivalence \n \n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export

Lengths in publishing contexts\n are sometimes written like 2p3,\n indicating a length of 2 picas and 3 points.\n These can be written in CSS as calc(2pc + 3pt) (see [§ 10.1 Basic Arithmetic: calc()](#calc-func)).\n\n \nAll of the absolute length units are [compatible](#compatible-units),\n and [px](#px) is their [canonical unit](#canonical-unit).\n\n \nFor a CSS device, these dimensions are **anchored** either\n\n \n\n by relating the [physical units](#physical-unit) to their physical measurements, or \n by relating the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit) to the [reference pixel](#reference-pixel). \n \n\n \nFor print media at typical viewing distances,\n the [anchor unit](#anchor-unit) should be one of the [physical units](#physical-unit) (inches, centimeters, etc).\n For screen media (including high-resolution devices),\n low-resolution devices,\n and devices with unusual viewing distances,\n it is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit).\n For such devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of [device pixels](#device-pixel) that best approximates the reference pixel.\n\n \nNote: If the [anchor unit](#anchor-unit) is the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit),\n the [physical units](#physical-unit) might not match their physical measurements.\n Alternatively if the anchor unit is a physical unit,\n the pixel unit might not map to a whole number of [device pixels](#device-pixel).\n\n \nNote: This definition of the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit) and the [physical units](#physical-unit) differs from the earlier editions of CSS1 and CSS2.\n In particular, in previous versions of CSS the pixel unit and the physical units were not related by a fixed ratio:\n the physical units were always tied to their physical measurements\n while the pixel unit would vary to most closely match the reference pixel.\n (This unfortunate change\n was made because too much existing content relies on the assumption of 96dpi,\n and breaking that assumption broke the content.)\n\n \nNote: Units are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive) and serialize as lowercase, for example 1Q serializes as 1q.\n\n \nThe **reference pixel** is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a [device pixel](#device-pixel) density of 96dpi\n and a distance from the reader of an arm’s length.\n For a nominal arm’s length of 28 inches,\n the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees.\n For reading at arm’s length,\n 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).\n\n \nThe image below illustrates the effect of viewing distance on the size of a reference pixel:\n a reading distance of 71 cm (28 inches)\n results in a reference pixel of 0.26 mm,\n while a reading distance of 3.5 m (12 feet)\n results in a reference pixel of 1.3 mm.\n\n \n \n Showing that pixels must become larger if the viewing distance increases\n \n \nThis second image illustrates the effect of a device’s resolution\n on the pixel unit: an area of 1px by 1px is covered by a single dot\n in a low-resolution device (e.g. a typical computer display), while\n the same area is covered by 16 dots in a higher resolution device\n (such as a printer).\n\n \n \n Showing that more device pixels (dots) are needed to cover a 1px by 1px area\n on a high-resolution device than on a lower-resolution one\n (of the same approximate viewing distance)\n \n \nA **device pixel** is the smallest unit of area on the device output\n capable of displaying its full range of colors.\n For typical color screens, it’s a square or somewhat rectangular region\n containing a red, green, and blue subpixel.\n Many non-traditional outputs exist that can blur this definition,\n such as by displaying some colors at higher resolutions.\n Such devices still expose some equivalent notion of \"device pixel\",\n

Combination of [<image>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#typedef-image)[](#combine-images)\n \nNote: Interpolation of [<image>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#typedef-image) is defined in [CSS Images 3 § 6 Interpolation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#interpolation).\n\n \nImages are [not additive](#not-additive).\n\n 8.3. 2D Positioning: the [<position>](#typedef-position) type[](#position)\n \nThe **[<position>](#typedef-position)** value specifies the position of a object area (e.g. background image)\n inside a positioning area (e.g. background positioning area).\n It is computed and interpreted as specified for [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position). [[CSS3-BACKGROUND]](#biblio-css3-background)\n\n```\n[<position>](#typedef-position) = [\n [ left [|](#comb-one) center [|](#comb-one) right [|](#comb-one) top [|](#comb-one) bottom [|](#comb-one) [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage) ]\n[|](#comb-one)\n [ left [|](#comb-one) center [|](#comb-one) right ] [&&](#comb-all) [ top [|](#comb-one) center [|](#comb-one) bottom ]\n[|](#comb-one)\n [ left [|](#comb-one) center [|](#comb-one) right [|](#comb-one) [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage) ]\n [ top [|](#comb-one) center [|](#comb-one) bottom [|](#comb-one) [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage) ]\n[|](#comb-one)\n [ [ left [|](#comb-one) right ] [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage) ] [&&](#comb-all)\n [ [ top [|](#comb-one) bottom ] [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage) ]\n]\n\n```\n\n \nNote: The [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) property also accepts a three-value syntax.\n This has been disallowed generically because it creates parsing ambiguities\n when combined with other length or percentage components in a property value.\n\n 8.3.1. Parsing [<position>](#typedef-position)[](#position-parsing)\n \nWhen specified in a grammar alongside other keywords, [<length>](#length-value)s, or [<percentage>](#percentage-value)s, [<position>](#typedef-position) is greedily parsed;\n it consumes as many components as possible.\n\n [](#example-2622a7d7) For example, [transform-origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#propdef-transform-origin) defines a 3D position\n as (effectively) <position> <length>?.\n A value such as left 50px will be parsed as a 2-value [<position>](#typedef-position),\n with an omitted z-component;\n on the other hand,\n a value such as top 50px will be parsed as a single-value <position> followed by a [<length>](#length-value). \n 8.3.2. Serializing [<position>](#typedef-position)[](#position-serialization)\n \nWhen serializing the [specified value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value) of a [<position>](#typedef-position):\n\n \n If only one component is specified: \n \n \n\n \n \nThe implied [center](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-background-position-center) keyword is added,\nand a 2-component value is serialized.\n\n \n\n If two components are specified: \n \n \n\n \n \nKeywords are serialized as keywords.\n\n \n \n[<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage)s are serialized as <length-percentage>s.\n\n \n \nComponents are serialized horizontal first, then vertical.\n\n \n\n If four components are specified: \n \n \n\n \n \nKeywords and offsets are both serialized.\n\n \n \nComponents are serialized horizontal first, then vertical.\n\n \n\n \n \nNote: [<position>](#typedef-position) values are never serialized as a single value,\n even when a single value would produce the same behavior,\n to avoid causing parsing ambiguities in some grammars\n where a <position> is placed next to a [<length>](#length-value),\n such as [transform-origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#propdef-transform-origin).\n\n \nNote: [Computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) are always serialized as two offsets (without keywords)\n because the computed value does not preserve syntactic distinctions.\n\n 8.3.3. Combination of [<position>](#typedef-position)[](#combine-positions)\n \n[Interpolation](#interpolation) of [<position>](#typedef-position) is defined as\n the independent interpolation of each component (x, y)\n normalized as an offset from the top left corner\n as a [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage).\n\n \n[Addition](#addition) of [<position>](#typedef-position) is likewise defined as\n the independent addition each component (x, y)\n normalized as an offset from the top left corner\n as a [<length-percentage>](#typedef-length-percentage).",

Basic Arithmetic: [calc()](#funcdef-calc)[](#calc-func)\n \nThe **calc()** function is a [math function](#math-function) that allows basic arithmetic to be performed on numerical values,\n using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/),\n and parentheses.\n\n \nA [calc()](#funcdef-calc) function contains a single **calculation**,\n which is a sequence of values interspersed with operators,\n and possibly grouped by parentheses\n (matching the [<calc-sum>](#typedef-calc-sum) grammar),\n which represents the result of evaluating the expression\n using standard operator precedence rules\n (* and / bind tighter than + and -,\n and operators are otherwise evaluated left-to-right).\n The calc() function represents the result of its contained [calculation](#calc-calculation).\n\n \nComponents of a [calculation](#calc-calculation) can be literal values\n (such as 5px),\n other [math functions](#math-function),\n or other expressions, such as [var()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var),\n that evaluate to a valid argument type (like [<length>](#length-value)).\n\n \n [](#example-1daf921b) \n \n[Math functions](#math-function) can be used to combine value that use different units.\n In this example the author wants the margin box of each section\n to take up 1/3 of the space,\n so they start with 100%/3,\n then subtract the element’s borders and margins.\n ([box-sizing](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-box-sizing) can automatically achieve this effect for borders and padding,\n but a math function is needed if you want to include margins.)\n\n```\nsection {\n float: left;\n margin: 1em; border: solid 1px;\n width: calc(100% / 3 - 2 * 1em - 2 * 1px);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nSimilarly, in this example the gradient will show a color transition\n only in the first and last 20px of the element:\n\n```\n.fade {\n background-image: linear-gradient(silver 0%, white 20px,\n white calc(100% - 20px), silver 100%);\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-a73c5015) \n \n[Math functions](#math-function) can also be useful just to express values\n in a more natural, readable fashion,\n rather than as an obscure decimal.\n For example, the following sets the [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) so that exactly 35em fits within the viewport,\n ensuring that roughly the same amount of text always fills the screen no matter the screen size.\n\n```\n:root {\n font-size: calc(100vw / 35);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nFunctionality-wise, this is identical to just writing [font-size: 2.857vw](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size),\n but then the intent\n (that 35em fills the viewport)\n is much less clear to someone reading the code;\n the later reader will have to reverse the math themselves\n to figure out that 2.857 is meant to approximate 100/35.\n\n \n \n [](#example-baa620d3) \n \nStandard mathematical precedence rules for the operators apply: calc(2 + 3 * 4) is equal to 14,\n not 20.\n\n \nParentheses can be used to manipulate precedence: calc((2 + 3) * 4) is instead equal to 20.\n\n \nParentheses and nesting additional [calc()](#funcdef-calc) functions are equivalent;\n the preceding expression could equivalently have been written as calc(calc(2 + 3) * 4).\n This can be useful when building up values piecemeal via [var()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var),\n such as in the following example:\n\n```\n.aspect-ratio-box {\n --ar: calc(16 / 9);\n --w: calc(100% / 3);\n --h: calc(var(--w) / var(--ar));\n width: var(--w);\n height: var(--h);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nAlthough --ar could have been written as simply --ar: (16 / 9);, --w is used both on its own (in [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width))\n and as a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) component (in --h),\n so it has to be written as a full calc() function itself.\n\n \n 10.2. Comparison Functions: [min()](#funcdef-min), [max()](#funcdef-max), and [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp)[](#comp-func)\n \nThe comparison functions of [min()](#funcdef-min), [max()](#funcdef-max), and [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp) compare multiple [calculations](#calc-calculation) and represent the value of one of them.\n\n \nThe **min()** or **max()** functions\n contain one or more comma-separated [calculations](#calc-calculation),\n and represent the smallest (most negative) or largest (most positive) of them, respectively.\n\n \nThe **clamp()** function takes three [calculations](#calc-calculation)—​a minimum value, a central value, and a maximum value—​and represents its central calculation,\n clamped according to its min and max calculations,\n favoring the min calculation if it conflicts with the max.\n (That is, given clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX),\n it represents exactly the same value as max(MIN, min(VAL, MAX))).\n\n \nEither the min or max calculations\n (or even both)\n can instead be the keyword **none**,\n which indicates the value is not clamped from that side.\n (That is, clamp(MIN, VAL, none) is equivalent to max(MIN, VAL), clamp(none, VAL, MAX) is equivalent to min(VAL, MAX),\n and clamp(none, VAL, none) is equivalent to just calc(VAL).)\n\n \nFor all three functions,\n the argument [calculations](#calc-calculation) can resolve to any [<number>](#number-value), [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension), or [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n but must have a [consistent type](#css-consistent-type) or else the function is invalid;\n the result’s type will be the consistent type.\n\n \n [](#example-67532822) \n \n[min()](#funcdef-min), [max()](#funcdef-max), and [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp) can be used to make sure a value doesn’t exceed a \"safe\" limit:\n For example, \"responsive type\" that sets [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) with viewport units\n might still want a minimum size to ensure readability:\n\n```\n.type {\n /* Set font-size to 10x the average of vw and vh,\n but don’t let it go below 12px. */\n font-size: max(10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 12px);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nNote: Full math expressions are allowed in each of the arguments;\n there’s no need to nest a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) inside!\n You can also provide more than two arguments,\n if you have multiple constraints to apply.\n\n \n \n [](#example-50cf5aee) An occasional point of confusion when using [min()](#funcdef-min)/[max()](#funcdef-max) is that you use max() to impose a minimum value on something\n (that is, properties like [min-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-min-width) effectively use max()),\n and min() to impose a maximum value on something;\n it’s easy to accidentally reach for the opposite function\n and try to use min() to add a minimum size.\n Using [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp) can make the code read more naturally,\n as the value is nestled between its minimum and maximum: \n\n```\n.type {\n /* Force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px */\n font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px);\n}\n\n```\n\n \nOr, if you only wanted to impose a minimum size,\n but allow the font-size to grow as large as it wants:\n\n```\n.type {\n /* Force the font-size to be at least 12px */\n font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, none);\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \n Note that [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp),\n matching CSS conventions elsewhere,\n has its minimum value \"win\" over its maximum value\n if the two are in the \"wrong order\".\n That is, clamp(100px, ..., 50px) will resolve to 100px,\n exceeding its stated \"max\" value. \n \nIf alternate resolution mechanics are desired\n they can be achieved by combining [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp) with [min()](#funcdef-min) or [max()](#funcdef-max):\n\n \n To have MAX win over MIN:\n \n \nclamp(min(MIN, MAX), VAL, MAX).\nIf you want to avoid repeating the MAX calculation,\nyou can just reverse the nesting of functions that [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp) is defined against—​min(MAX, max(MIN, VAL)).\n\n To have MAX and MIN \"swap\" when they’re in the wrong order:\n \n \nclamp(min(MIN, MAX), VAL, max(MIN, MAX)).\nUnfortunately, there’s no easy way to do this without repeating the MIN and MAX terms.\n\n \n \n 10.3. Stepped Value Functions: [round()](#funcdef-round), [mod()](#funcdef-mod), and [rem()](#funcdef-rem)[](#round-func)\n \nThe stepped-value functions, [round()](#funcdef-round), [mod()](#funcdef-mod), and [rem()](#funcdef-rem),\n all transform a given value\n according to another \"step value\",\n in different ways.\n\n \nThe **round([<rounding-strategy>](#typedef-rounding-strategy)?, A, B?)** function\n contains an optional rounding strategy,\n and two [calculations](#calc-calculation) A and B,\n and returns the value of A,\n rounded according to the rounding strategy,\n to the nearest integer multiple of B either above or below A.\n The argument calculations can resolve to any [<number>](#number-value), [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension), or [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n but must have a [consistent type](#css-consistent-type) or else the function is invalid;\n the result’s type will be the consistent type.\n\n \nIf A is exactly equal to an integer multiple of B, [round()](#funcdef-round) resolves to A exactly\n (preserving whether A is 0⁻ or 0⁺, if relevant).\n Otherwise, there are two integer multiples of B that are potentially \"closest\" to A, lower B which is closer to −∞\n and upper B which is closer to +∞.\n The following **[<rounding-strategy>](#typedef-rounding-strategy)**s dictate how to choose between them:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-rounding-strategy-nearest\">nearest**\n \n \nChoose whichever of lower B and upper B that has the smallest absolute difference from A.\nIf both have an equal difference\n(A is exactly between the two values),\nchoose upper B.\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-rounding-strategy-up\">up**\n \n \nChoose upper B.\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-rounding-strategy-down\">down**\n \n \nChoose lower B.\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-rounding-strategy-to-zero\">to-zero**\n \n \nChoose whichever of lower B and upper B that has the smallest absolute difference from 0.\n\n \n \nIf lower B would be zero,\n it is specifically equal to 0⁺;\n if upper B would be zero,\n it is specifically equal to 0⁻.\n\n \nIf [<rounding-strategy>](#typedef-rounding-strategy) is omitted,\n it defaults to [nearest](#valdef-rounding-strategy-nearest).\n (Aka [rounding to the nearest integer](#css-round-to-the-nearest-integer).)\n If the [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) of A\n matches [<number>](#number-value),\n then B may be omitted,\n and defaults to 1;\n omitting B is otherwise invalid.\n\n \n[](#issue-1a929fd0) CSSOM needs to specify how it rounds,\n and it’s probably good for CSS functions to round the same way by default.\n What behavior should be used? [[Issue #5689]](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5689)\n\n [](#example-1c1bb50d) Unlike languages like JavaScript\n which have a natural \"precision\" to round to\n (integers),\n CSS values have no such precision\n because values can be written in many different compatible units.\n As such, the precision has to be given explicitly;\n to round a width to the nearest 50px,\n one can write round(var(--width), 50px). \n \nNote: JavaScript and other programming languages\n sometimes separate out the rounding strategies into separate rounding functions.\n JS’s Math.floor() is equivalent to CSS’s round(down, ...);\n JS’s Math.ceil() is equivalent to CSS’s round(up, ...);\n JS’s Math.trunc() is equivalent to CSS’s round(to-zero, ...);\n and JS’s Math.round() is equivalent to CSS’s round(nearest, ...),\n or just round(...).\n\n \nNote: The [<rounding-strategy>](#typedef-rounding-strategy) keywords\n are the same as the keywords in [block-step-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-rhythm-1/#propdef-block-step-size) and have the same behavior.\n (block-step-size just lacks [to-zero](#valdef-rounding-strategy-to-zero);\n since block sizes are always non-negative, to-zero and [down](#valdef-rounding-strategy-down) would be identical.)\n\n \nThe modulus functions **mod(A, B)** and **rem(A, B)** similarly contain two [calculations](#calc-calculation) A and B,\n and return the difference between A\n and the nearest integer multiple of B either above or below A.\n The argument calculations can resolve to any [<number>](#number-value), [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension), or [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n but must have the same [type](#determine-the-type-of-a-calculation),\n or else the function is invalid;\n the result will have the same [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) as the arguments.\n\n \nThe two functions are very similar,\n and in fact return identical results\n if both arguments are positive or both are negative:\n the value of the function is equal to the value of A\n shifted by the integer multiple of B\n that brings the value **between zero and B**.\n (Specifically, the range includes zero\n and excludes B.\n More specifically, if B is positive the range starts at 0⁺,\n and if B is negative it starts at 0⁻.)\n\n \n [](#example-1588859b) For example, mod(18px, 5px) resolves to the value 3px,\n because subtracting 5px * 3 from 18px yields 3px,\n which is the only such value between 0px and 3px. \n \nSimilarly, mod(-140deg, -90deg) resolves to the value -50deg,\n because adding -90deg * 1 to -140deg yields -50deg,\n which is the only such value between 0deg and -90deg.\n\n \nEvaluating either of these examples with [rem()](#funcdef-rem) yields the exact same results.\n\n \n \nTheir behavior diverges if the A value and the B step\n are on opposite sides of zero: [mod()](#funcdef-mod) (short for “modulus”)\n continues to choose the integer multiple of B\n that puts the value [between zero and B](#between-zero-and-b), as above\n (guaranteeing that the result will either be zero\n or share the sign of B, not A),\n while [rem()](#funcdef-rem) (short for \"remainder\")\n chooses the integer multiple of B\n that puts the value between zero and -B,\n avoiding changing the sign of the value.\n\n \n [](#example-3a2ef59d) For example, mod(-18px, 5px) resolves to the value 2px:\n adding 5px * 4 to -18px yields 2px,\n which is between 0px and 5px. \n \nOn the other hand, rem(-18px, 5px) resolves to the value -3px:\n adding 5px * 3 to -18px yields -3px,\n which has the same sign as -18px but is between 0px and -5px.\n\n \nSimilarly, mod(140deg, -90deg) resolves to the value -40deg (adding -90deg * 2 to 140deg,\n bringing it to between 0deg and -90deg),\n but rem(140deg, -90deg) resolves to the value 50deg.\n\n \n \n When should I choose [mod()](#funcdef-mod) vs [rem()](#funcdef-rem)?\n \nTypically, users of this operation\n are in control of the step value (B),\n and are modifying an unknown value A.\n As a result, it’s usually more expected\n that the result is between 0 and B,\n regardless of A’s sign,\n meaning [mod()](#funcdef-mod) should be chosen.\n\n \nFor example,\n if an author wants to know whether a length\n is an even or odd number of pixels, mod(A, 2px) will return either 0px or 1px (assuming the value is a whole number of pixels to begin with),\n regardless of the value of a. rem(A, 2px), on the other hand,\n will return 0px if A is an even number of pixels,\n but will return either 1px or -1px if it’s odd,\n depending on whether A is positive or negative.\n\n \nThe opposite situation does sometimes occur,\n however,\n and so [rem()](#funcdef-rem) is provided to cater to that.\n As well, rem() is the behavior of JavaScript’s % operator,\n so if an exact match between CSS and JS code is desired, rem() can be useful.\n\n \n \nNote: [mod()](#funcdef-mod) and [rem()](#funcdef-rem) can also be defined directly in terms of other functions: mod(A, B) is equivalent to calc(A - sign(B)*round(down, A*sign(B), B)) (a hacky way to say \"round(down) when B is positive, round(up) when B is negative),\n while rem(A, B) is equivalent to calc(A - round(to-zero, A, B)).\n (These expressions don’t always handle 0⁺ and 0⁻ correctly,

Exponential Functions: [pow()](#funcdef-pow), [sqrt()](#funcdef-sqrt), [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot), [log()](#funcdef-log), [exp()](#funcdef-exp)[](#exponent-funcs)\n \nThe exponential functions—​[pow()](#funcdef-pow), [sqrt()](#funcdef-sqrt), [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot), [log()](#funcdef-log), and [exp()](#funcdef-exp)—​compute various exponential functions with their arguments.\n\n \nThe **pow(A, B)** function\n contains two comma-separated [calculations](#calc-calculation) A and B,\n both of which must resolve to [<number>](#number-value)s,\n and returns the result of raising A to the power of B,\n returning the value as a <number>.\n The input calculations must have a [consistent type](#css-consistent-type) or else the function is invalid;\n the result’s type will be the consistent type.\n\n \nThe **sqrt(A)** function\n contains a single [calculation](#calc-calculation) which must resolve to a [<number>](#number-value),\n and returns the square root of the value\n as a <number>,\n with the return type [made consistent](#css-make-a-type-consistent) with the input calculation’s type.\n (sqrt(X) and pow(X, .5) are basically equivalent,\n differing only in some error-handling; [sqrt()](#funcdef-sqrt) is a common enough function\n that it is provided as a convenience.)\n\n \nThe **hypot(A, …)** function\n contains one or more comma-separated [calculations](#calc-calculation),\n and returns the length of an N-dimensional vector\n with components equal to each of the calculations.\n (That is,\n the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments.)\n The argument calculations can resolve to any [<number>](#number-value), [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension), or [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n but must have a [consistent type](#css-consistent-type) or else the function is invalid;\n the result’s type will be the consistent type.\n\n \n Why does [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot) allow dimensions (values with units), but [pow()](#funcdef-pow) and [sqrt()](#funcdef-sqrt) only work on numbers?\n \nYou are allowed to write expressions like hypot(30px, 40px),\n which resolves to 50px,\n but you aren’t allowed to write the expression sqrt(pow(30px, 2) + pow(40px, 2)),\n despite the two being equivalent in most mathematical systems.\n\n \nThere are two reasons for this:\n numeric precision in the exponents,\n and clashing expectations from authors.\n\n \nFirst, numerical precision.\n For a [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) to [match](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-match) a CSS production like [<length>](#length-value),\n it needs to have a single unit with its exponent set to exactly 1.\n Theoretically, expressions like pow(pow(30px, 3), 1/3) should result in exactly that:\n the inner pow(30px, 3) would resolve to a value of 27000 with a type of «[ \"length\" → 3 ]»\n (aka <length>³),\n and then the pow(X, 1/3) would cube-root the value back down to 30 and multiply the exponent by 1/3,\n giving «[ \"length\" → 1 ]»,\n which matches <length>.\n\n \nIn the realm of pure mathematics, that’s guaranteed to work out;\n in the real-world of computers using binary floating-point arithmetic,\n in some cases the powers might not exactly cancel out,\n leaving you with an invalid [math function](#math-function) for confusing, hard-to-track-down reasons.\n (For a JS example,\n evaluate Math.pow(Math.pow(30, 10/3), .1+.1+.1);\n the result is not exactly 30,\n because .1+.1+.1 is not exactly 3/10.\n Instead, (10/3) * (.1 + .1 + .1) is slightly greater than 1.)\n\n \nRequiring authors to cast their value down into a number,\n do all the math on the raw number,\n then finally send it back to the desired unit,\n while inconvenient,\n ensures that numerical precision won’t bite anyone: calc(pow(pow(30px / 1px, 3), 1/3) * 1px) is guaranteed to resolve to a [<length>](#length-value),\n with a value that, if not exactly 30, is at least very close to 30,\n even if numerical precision actually prevents the powers from exactly canceling.\n\n \nSecond, clashing expectations.\n It’s not uncommon for authors to expect pow(30px, 2) to result in 900px (such as in [this Sass issue](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/684));\n that is,\n just squaring the numerical value\n and leaving the unit alone.\n This, however, means the result is dependent on what unit you’re expressing the argument in;\n if 1em is 16px,\n then pow(1em, 2) would give 1em,\n while pow(16px, 2) would give 256px, or 16em,\n which are very different values for what should otherwise be identical input arguments!\n This sort of input dependency is troublesome for CSS,\n which generally allows values to be [canonicalized](#canonical-unit) freely;\n it also makes more complex expressions like pow(2em + 10px, 2) difficult to interpret.\n\n \nAgain, requiring authors to cast their value down into a number\n and then back up again into the desired unit\n sidesteps these issues; pow(30, 2) is indeed 900,\n and the author can interpret that however they wish.\n\n \n \nOn the other hand, [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot) doesn’t suffer from these problems.\n Numerical precision in units isn’t a concern,\n as the inputs and output all have the same type.\n The result isn’t unit-dependent, either,\n due to the nature of the operation; hypot(3em, 4em) and hypot(48px, 64px) both result in the same length\n when 1em equals 16px: 5em or 80px.\n Thus it’s fine to let author use dimensions directly in hypot().\n\n \n \nThe **log(A, B?)** function\n contains one or two [calculations](#calc-calculation) (representing the value to be logarithmed,\n and the base of the logarithm,\n defaulting to e),\n which must resolve to [<number>](#number-value)s,\n and returns the logarithm base B of the value A,\n as a <number> with the return type [made consistent](#css-make-a-type-consistent) with the input calculation’s type.\n\n \nThe **exp(A)** function\n contains one [calculation](#calc-calculation) which must resolve to a [<number>](#number-value),\n and returns the same value as pow(e, A) as a <number> with the return type [made consistent](#css-make-a-type-consistent) with the input calculation’s type.\n\n \n [](#example-bebe620e) The [pow()](#funcdef-pow) function can be useful for strategies like [CSS Modular Scale](https://www.modularscale.com/),\n which relates all the font-sizes on a page to each other by a fixed ratio. \n \nThese sizes can be easily written into custom properties like:\n\n```\n:root {\n --h6: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, -1));\n --h5: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 0));\n --h4: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 1));\n --h3: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 2));\n --h2: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 3));\n --h1: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 4));\n}\n\n```\n\n \n...rather than writing out the values in pre-calculated numbers like 5.0625rem (what calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 4)) resolves to)\n which have less clear provenance when encountered in a stylesheet.\n\n \n \n [](#example-d7f26d9d) With a single argument, [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot) gives the absolute value of its input; hypot(2em) and hypot(-2em) both resolve to 2em. \n \nWith more arguments,\n it gives the size of the main diagonal of a box\n whose side lengths are given by the arguments.\n This can be useful for transform-related things,\n giving the distance that an element will actually travel\n when it’s translated by a particular X, Y, and Z amount.\n\n \nFor example, hypot(30px, 40px) resolves to 50px,\n which is indeed the distance between an element’s starting and ending positions\n when it’s translated by a translate(30px, 40px) transform.\n If an author wanted elements to get smaller as they moved further away from their starting point\n (drawing some sort of word cloud, for example),\n they could then use this distance in their scaling factor calculations.\n\n \n \n [](#example-d939ff73) With a single argument, [log()](#funcdef-log) provides the “natural log” of its argument,\n or the log base e,\n same as JavaScript. \n \nIf one instead wants log base 10\n (to, for example, count the number of digits in a value)\n or log base 2\n (counting the number of bits in a value), log(X, 10) or log(X, 2) provide those values.\n\n \n 10.5.1.

Sign-Related Functions: [abs()](#funcdef-abs), [sign()](#funcdef-sign)[](#sign-funcs)\n \nThe sign-related functions—​[abs()](#funcdef-abs) and [sign()](#funcdef-sign)—​compute various functions related to the sign of their argument.\n\n \nThe **abs(A)** function\n contains one [calculation](#calc-calculation) A,\n and returns the absolute value of A,\n as the same [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) as the input:\n if A’s numeric value is positive or 0⁺, just A again;\n otherwise -1 * A.\n\n \nThe **sign(A)** function\n contains one [calculation](#calc-calculation) A,\n and returns -1 if A’s numeric value is negative,\n +1 if A’s numeric value is positive,\n 0⁺ if A’s numeric value is 0⁺,\n and 0⁻ if A’s numeric value is 0⁻.\n The return type is a [<number>](#number-value), [made consistent](#css-make-a-type-consistent) with the input calculation’s type.\n\n \nNote: Both of these functions operate on the fully simplified/resolved form of their arguments,\n which may give unintuitive results at first glance.\n In particular,\n an expression like 10% might be positive or negative once it’s resolved,\n depending on what value it’s resolved against.\n For example, in [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) positive percentages\n resolve to a negative length,\n and vice versa,\n if the background image is larger than the background area.\n Thus sign(10%) might return 1 or -1,\n depending on how the percentage is resolved!\n (Or even 0, if it’s resolved against a zero length.)\n\n 10.7. Numeric Keywords[](#calc-keywords)\n \nKeywords in [calculations](#calc-calculation) provide access to values that are difficult or impossible to represent as literals.\n Each keyword defines its value,\n its [type](#determine-the-type-of-a-calculation),\n and when it can be resolved.\n\n 10.7.1. Numeric Constants: [e](#valdef-calc-e), [pi](#valdef-calc-pi)[](#calc-constants)\n \nWhile the trigonometric and exponential functions\n handle many complex numeric operations,\n some reasonable calculations must be put together more manually,\n and many times these include well-known constants,\n such as e and π.\n\n \nRather than require authors to manually type out\n several digits of these constants,\n a few of them are provided directly:\n\n \n **e**\n \n \nthe base of the natural logarithm,\napproximately equal to 2.7182818284590452354.\n\n **pi**\n \n \nthe ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter,\napproximately equal to 3.1415926535897932.\n\n \n \nBoth of these keywords are [<number>](#number-value)s,\n and resolve at parse time.\n\n \nNote: These keywords are only usable within a calculation,\n such as calc(pow(e, pi) - pi), or min(pi, 5, e).\n If used outside of a calculation,\n they’re treated like any other keyword: [animation-name: pi;](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation-name) refers to an animation named \"pi\"; [line-height: e;](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-line-height) is invalid\n (not similar to line-height: 2.7,\n but line-height: calc(e); is).\n\n 10.7.2. Degenerate Numeric Constants: [infinity](#valdef-calc-infinity), [-infinity](#valdef-calc--infinity), [NaN](#valdef-calc-nan)[](#calc-error-constants)\n \nWhen a [calculation](#calc-calculation) or a subtree of a calculation becomes [infinite](#css-infinity) or [NaN](#css-nan),\n representing it with a numeric value is no longer possible.\n To aid in serialization of these degenerate values,\n the following additional math constants are defined:\n\n \n **infinity**\n \n \nthe value positive infinity (+∞)\n\n **-infinity**\n \n \nthe value negative infinity (−∞)\n\n **NaN**\n \n \nthe value NaN\n\n \n \nAll of these keywords are [<number>](#number-value)s,\n and resolve at parse time.\n\n \nAs usual for CSS keywords,\n these are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive). Thus, calc(InFiNiTy) is perfectly valid. However, [NaN](#valdef-calc-nan) must be serialized with this canonical casing.\n\n \nNote: As these keywords are [<number>](#number-value)s,\n to get an infinite length,\n for example,\n requires an expression like calc(infinity * 1px).\n\n \nNote: These constants are defined mostly to make serialization of infinite/NaN values simpler and more obvious,\n but can be used to indicate a \"largest possible value\",\n since an infinite value gets clamped to the allowed range.\n It’s rare for this to be reasonable,\n but when it is,\n using [infinity](#valdef-calc-infinity) is clearer in its intent\n than just putting an enormous number in one’s stylesheet.\n\n 10.7.3. Numeric Variables[](#calc-variables)\n \nOther specifications can define additional keywords\n which are usable in [calculations](#calc-calculation) in certain contexts.\n For example, [relative color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#relative-color) syntax\n defines a number of color-channel keywords\n representing the value of each color channel as a [<number>](#number-value).\n\n \nEach specifications defining such keywords\n must define for each keyword:\n\n \n\n \n \nits value\n\n \n \nits [type](#determine-the-type-of-a-calculation) ([<number>](#number-value), [<length>](#length-value), etc)\n\n \n \nwhen it resolves (parse time, computed-value time, or used-value time)\n\n \n\n 10.8.

Type Checking[](#calc-type-checking)\n \nA [math function](#math-function) can be many possible types,\n such as [<length>](#length-value), [<number>](#number-value), etc.,\n depending on the [calculations](#calc-calculation) it contains,\n as defined below.\n It can be used anywhere a value of that type is allowed.\n\n [](#example-40312766) For example, the [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) property accepts [<length>](#length-value) values,\n so a [math function](#math-function) that resolves to a <length>,\n such as calc(5px + 1em),\n can be used in width. \n \nAdditionally, [math functions](#math-function) that resolve to [<number>](#number-value) can be used in any place that only accepts [<integer>](#integer-value);\n the value is [rounded to the nearest integer](#css-round-to-the-nearest-integer) as it resolves.\n\n \nOperators form sub-expressions, which gain types based on their arguments.\n\n \nNote: In previous versions of this specification,\n multiplication and division were limited in what arguments they could take,\n to avoid producing more complex intermediate results\n (such as 1px * 1em, which is [<length>](#length-value)²)\n and to make division-by-zero detectable at parse time.\n This version now relaxes those restrictions.\n\n \n To **determine the type of a [calculation](#calc-calculation)**: \n \n\n \n \nAt a + or - sub-expression,\nattempt to [add the types](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-add-two-types) of the left and

To make a type base consistent with another type input: \n \n\n \n \nIf both base and input have different non-null [percent hints](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-percent-hint),\nthey can’t be made consistent.\nReturn failure.\n\n \n \nIf base has a null [percent hint](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-percent-hint) set base’s percent hint to input’s percent hint.\n\n \n \nReturn base.\n\n \n\n \n \n[Math functions](#math-function) themselves have [types](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type),\n according to their contained [calculations](#calc-calculation):\n\n \n [calc()](#funcdef-calc)\n [abs()](#funcdef-abs)\n \n \nThe [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) of its contained [calculation](#calc-calculation).\n\n [min()](#funcdef-min)\n [max()](#funcdef-max)\n [clamp()](#funcdef-clamp)\n [hypot()](#funcdef-hypot)\n [round()](#funcdef-round)\n [mod()](#funcdef-mod)\n [rem()](#funcdef-rem)\n \n \nThe result of [adding the

[type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) is failure,\n the [math function](#math-function) is invalid.\n\n \nA [math function](#math-function) resolves to [<number>](#number-value), [<length>](#length-value), [<angle>](#angle-value), [<time>](#time-value), [<frequency>](#frequency-value), [<resolution>](#resolution-value), [<flex>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#typedef-flex), or [<percentage>](#percentage-value) according to which of those productions its [type](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-type) [matches](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/#cssnumericvalue-match).\n (These categories are mutually exclusive.)\n If it can’t match any of these,\n the math function is invalid.\n\n \nNote: Algebraic simplifications do not affect the validity of a [math function](#math-function) or its resolved type.\n For example, calc(5px - 5px + 10s) and calc(0 * 5px + 10s) are both invalid\n due to the attempt to add a length and a time.\n\n \nNote: Note that [<percentage>](#percentage-value)s relative to [<number>](#number-value)s,\n such as in [opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-opacity),\n are not combinable with those numbers—​opacity: calc(.25 + 25%) is invalid.\n Allowing this causes significant problems with \"unit algebra\"\n (allowing multiplication/division of [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension)s),\n and in every case so far,\n doesn’t provide any new functionality.\n (For example, opacity: 25% is identical to opacity: .25;\n it’s just a trivial syntax transform.)\n You can still perform other operations with them,\n such as opacity: calc(100% / 3);,\n which is valid.\n\n \nNote: Because [<number-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-number-token)s are always interpreted as [<number>](#number-value)s or [<integer>](#integer-value)s,\n \"unitless 0\" [<length>](#length-value)s aren’t supported in [math functions](#math-function).\n That is, [width: calc(0 + 5px);](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) is invalid,\n because it’s trying to add a <number> to a <length>,\n even though both width: 0; and width: 5px; are valid.\n\n \nNote: Although there are a few properties in which a bare [<number>](#number-value) becomes a [<length>](#length-value) at used-value time\n (specifically, [line-height](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-line-height) and [tab-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#propdef-tab-size)), <number>s never become \"length-like\" in [calc()](#funcdef-calc).\n They always stay as <number>s.\n\n \nNote: In Quirks Mode [[QUIRKS]](#biblio-quirks),\n some properties that would normally only accept [<length>](#length-value)s\n are defined to also accept [<number>](#number-value)s,\n interpreting them as [px](#px) lengths.\n Like unitless zeroes,\n this has no effect on the parsing or behavior of [math functions](#math-function),\n though a math function that resolves to a <number> value\n might become valid in Quirks Mode\n (and have its result interpreted as a px length).\n\n 10.9.1. Infinities, NaN, and Signed Zero[](#calc-ieee)\n \n[Math functions](#math-function) follow IEEE-754 semantics,\n which means they recognize the concepts of\n positive and negative zero,\n positive and negative infinity,\n and NaN (not a number).\n\n \nHowever, these concepts are only retained within a [calculation tree](#calculation-tree);\n if a **top-level calculation** (a [math function](#math-function) not nested directly inside of another math function)\n would result in one of these special values,\n they’re instead \"censored\" into a standard representable value,\n as defined below.\n\n \n**Signed zeros** (indicated here as 0⁺ or 0⁻)\n can not be written directly in CSS; 0, +0 and -0 all produce the standard \"unsigned\" zero,\n which is considered positive (0⁺)\n for the purposes of these rules.\n\n \n[Signed zeroes](#css-signed-zero) are produced in the following ways:\n\n \n\n \n \nNegative zero\n(0⁻)\ncan be produced by a multiplication or division that produces zero\nwith exactly one negative argument\n(such as -5 * 0 or 1 / -infinity).\n\n \n \n0⁻ + 0⁻ or 0⁻ - 0⁺ produces 0⁻.\nAll other additions or subtractions that would produce a zero\nproduce 0⁺.\n\n \n \nMultiplying or dividing 0⁻ with a positive number\n(including 0⁺)\nproduces a negative result\n(either 0⁻ or −∞),\nwhile multiplying or dividing 0⁻ with a negative number\nproduces a positive result.\n\n \n(In other words,\nmultiplying or dividing with 0⁻\nfollows standard sign rules.)\n\n \n \nWhen comparing 0⁺ and 0⁻,\n0⁻ is less than 0⁺.\nFor example, min(0⁺, 0⁻) must produce 0⁻, max(0⁺, 0⁻) must produce 0⁺,\nand clamp(0⁺, 0⁻, 1) must produce 0⁺.\n\n \n \nCertain argument combinations in [math functions](#math-function) are defined to produce 0⁻\n(for example, round(-1, infinity)).\nAll other operations that produce a zero\nproduce positive zero (0⁺).\n\n \n\n \n[Signed zeroes](#css-signed-zero) do not escape a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation);\n they’re censored into the \"unsigned\" zero.\n\n \n**Infinities** (indicated here as +∞ or −∞)\n can be written directly\n using the [math constants](#calc-error-constants) [infinity](#valdef-calc-infinity) and [-infinity](#valdef-calc--infinity),\n or produced as a result of some calculations:\n\n \n\n \n \nDividing a value by zero produces either +∞ or −∞,\naccording to the standard sign rules.\n\n \n \nAdding or subtracting ±∞ to anything produces the appropriate infinity.\n\n \n \nMultiplying any value by ±∞ produces the appropriate infinity.\n\n \n \nDividing any value by ±∞ produces zero.\n\n \n \nCertain argument combinations in [math functions](#math-function) are defined to produce [infinities](#css-infinity) (for example, pow(0, -1) produces +∞).\n\n \n\n \nNote: The rules for producing [NaN](#css-nan), below,\n supersede the above rules for producing [infinities](#css-infinity).\n\n \n[Infinities](#css-infinity) do not escape a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation);\n they’re clamped to the minimum or maximum value allowed in the context,\n as defined in [§ 10.12 Range Checking](#calc-range).\n\n \n**NaN** (short for \"not a number\")\n is the result of certain operations\n that don’t have a well-defined value.\n It can be written directly\n using the [math constants](#calc-error-constants) [NaN](#valdef-calc-nan),\n or produced as a result of some calculations:\n\n \n\n \n \nDividing zero by zero,\ndividing ±∞ by ±∞,\nmultiplying 0 by ±∞,\nadding +∞ to −∞,\nor subtracting two infinities of the same sign\nproduces NaN.\n\n \nThese rules override any other result,\nif there’s a conflict.\nFor example, 0 / 0 is NaN, not +∞.\n\n \n \nCertain argument combinations in [math functions](#math-function) are defined to produce [NaN](#css-nan) (for example, asin(2) produces NaN).\n\n \n \nAny operation with at least one NaN argument produces NaN.\n\n \n\n \n[NaN](#css-nan) does not escape a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation);\n it’s censored into a zero value\n\n \n [](#example-07a5380d) For example, calc(-5 * 0) produces an unsigned zero—​the calculation resolves to 0⁻,\n but as it’s a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation),\n it’s then censored to an unsigned zero. \n \nOn the other hand, calc(1 / calc(-5 * 0)) produces −∞,\n same as calc(1 / (-5 * 0))—​the inner calc resolves to 0⁻,\n and as it’s not a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation),\n it passes it up unchanged to the outer calc to produce −∞.\n If it was censored into an unsigned zero,\n it would instead produce +∞.\n\n \n 10.10.

Computed Value[](#calc-computed-value)\n \nThe [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of a [math function](#math-function) is its [calculation tree](#calculation-tree) [simplified](#simplify-a-calculation-tree),\n using all the information available at computed value time.\n (Such as the [em](#em) to [px](#px) ratio,\n how to resolve percentages in some properties,\n etc.)\n\n \nWhere percentages are not resolved at computed-value time,\n they are not resolved in [math functions](#math-function),\n e.g. calc(100% - 100% + 1px) resolves to calc(0% + 1px),\n not to 1px.\n If there are special rules for computing percentages in a value\n (e.g. [the height property](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-property)),\n they apply whenever a math function contains percentages.\n\n \nThe [calculation tree](#calculation-tree) is again simplified at [used value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) time;\n with used value time information,\n a [math function](#math-function) always simplifies down to a single numeric value.\n\n \n [](#example-023dad93) For example,\n whereas [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) computes percentage values at [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) time\n so that [font-relative length](#font-relative-length) units can be computed, [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) has layout-dependent behavior for percentage values,\n and thus does not resolve percentages until used-value time. \n \nDue to this, [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) computation preserves the percentage in a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) whereas [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) will compute such expressions directly into a length.\n\n \n \nGiven the complexities of width and height calculations on table cells and table elements,\n math expressions mixing both percentages and non-zero lengths for widths and heights on\n table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells\n in both auto and fixed layout tables\n MUST be treated as if [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto) had been specified.\n\n 10.12. Range Checking[](#calc-range)\n \nParse-time range-checking of values is not performed within [math functions](#math-function),\n and therefore out-of-range values do not cause the declaration to become invalid.\n However, the value resulting from a [top-level calculation](#top-level-calculation) must be clamped to the range allowed in the target context.\n Clamping is performed on [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) to the extent possible,\n and also on [used values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) if computation was unable to sufficiently simplify the expression\n to allow range-checking.\n (Clamping is not performed on [specified values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value).)\n\n \nNote: This requires all contexts accepting [calc()](#funcdef-calc) to define their allowable values as a closed (not open) interval.\n\n \nNote: By definition,\n ±∞ are outside the allowed range for any property,\n and will clamp to the minimum/maximum value allowed.\n Even properties that can explicitly represent infinity as a keyword value,\n such as [animation-iteration-count](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation-iteration-count),\n will end up clamping ±∞,\n as [math functions](#math-function) can’t resolve to keyword values;\n the numeric part of the property’s syntax still has a minimum/maximum value.\n\n \nAdditionally, if a [math function](#math-function) that resolves to [<number>](#number-value) is used somewhere that only accepts [<integer>](#integer-value),\n the [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) and [used value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) are [rounded to the nearest integer](#css-round-to-the-nearest-integer),\n in the same manner as clamping, above.\n\n \n [](#example-ec14dee2) Since widths smaller than 0px are not allowed,\n these three declarations are equivalent: \n\n```\nwidth: calc(5px - 10px);\nwidth: calc(-5px);\nwidth: 0px;\n\n```\n\n \nNote however that [width: -5px](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) is not equivalent to width: calc(-5px)!\n Out-of-range values outside [calc()](#funcdef-calc) are syntactically invalid,\n and cause the entire declaration to be dropped.\n\n \n 10.13.
