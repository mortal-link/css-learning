Baselines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#intro-baselines).\n\n \n**Baseline alignment** is a form of positional alignment\n that aligns multiple [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject)\n within a [shared alignment context](#shared-alignment-context)\n (such as cells within a row)\n by matching up their [alignment baselines](#alignment-baseline).\n If the position of the alignment subjects within a [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group)\n is not fully constrained by [baseline alignment](#baseline-alignment)\n (i.e., they could be shifted within their respective [alignment containers](#alignment-container)\n while maintaining baseline-alignment),\n they are [fallback-aligned](#fallback-alignment) insofar as possible while preserving their baseline alignment.\n\n \nThe baseline alignment keywords are represented with the [<baseline-position>](#typedef-baseline-position) grammar term:\n\n```\n**<baseline-position>** = [ first [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) last ][?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt) [&&](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-all) baseline\n\n```\n\n \nThe [first](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline) and [last](#valdef-justify-self-last-baseline) values give a box a **baseline alignment preference**:\n either “first” or “last”, respectively,\n defaulting to “first”.\n\n \nValues have the following meanings:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-justify-self-baseline\">baseline**\n \n \n Computes to [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline), defined below.\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export data-lt=\"first baseline | first\" id=\"valdef-justify-self-first-baseline\">first baseline**\n \n \n \n Specifies participation in **first-baseline alignment**:\n aligns the [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline) of the box’s [first baseline set](#first-baseline-set)\n with the corresponding baseline\n of its [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group).\n See [§ 9.3 Aligning Boxes by Baseline](#align-by-baseline) for more details.\n\n \nThe [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) for [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline) is\n safe self-start (for [self-alignment](#self-align))\n or safe start (for [content-distribution](#content-distribute)).\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export data-lt=\"last baseline | last\" id=\"valdef-justify-self-last-baseline\">last baseline**\n \n \n \n Specifies participation in **last-baseline alignment**:\n aligns the [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline) of the box’s [last baseline set](#last-baseline-set)\n with the corresponding baseline\n of its [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group).̣\n See [§ 9.3 Aligning Boxes by Baseline](#align-by-baseline) for more details.\n\n \nThe [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) for [last baseline](#valdef-justify-self-last-baseline) is\n safe self-end (for [self-alignment](#self-align))\n or safe end (for [content-distribution](#content-distribute)).\n\n \n \nWhen specified for [align-content](#propdef-align-content),\n these values trigger [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment),\n shifting the content of the box within its content box,\n and may also affect the sizing of the box itself.\n See [§ 5.4 Baseline Content-Alignment](#baseline-align-content).\n\n \nWhen specified for [align-self](#propdef-align-self)/[justify-self](#propdef-justify-self),\n these values trigger [baseline self-alignment](#baseline-self-alignment),\n shifting the entire box within its container,\n which may affect the sizing of its container.\n See [§ 6.4 Baseline Self-Alignment](#baseline-align-self).\n\n \nWhen [baseline self-alignment](#baseline-self-alignment) is specified on a box,\n [content distribution](#content-distribute) is performed first,\n then the resulting box and its contents\n are self-aligned\n However, if the box also has [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment) in the same axis\n or if its [content-distribution property](#content-distribution-properties) in the same axis is [normal](#valdef-justify-content-normal),\n its [used](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) content-distribution property in that axis\n is [start](#valdef-self-position-start) or safe end\n for a [baseline alignment preference](#baseline-alignment-preference) of its baseline self-alignment\n of “first” or “last”, respectively.\n\n \n[](#issue-13b9ed6a)Add example images here.\n\n \nIf a box does not belong to a [shared alignment context](#shared-alignment-context),\n then the [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) is used.\n For example, [align-content: baseline](#propdef-align-content) on a block box\n falls back to [start](#valdef-self-position-start) alignment.\n The fallback alignment is also used to align the [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group)\n within its [alignment container](#alignment-container).\n\n \nNote: Because they are equivalent, and [baseline](#valdef-justify-self-baseline) is shorter,\n the CSSOM serializes [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline) as baseline.\n See [CSSOM § 6.7.2 Serializing CSS Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values).\n\n \nNote: For the somewhat-related [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align) property,\n due to inconsistent design decisions in CSS2.1,\n [baseline](#valdef-justify-self-baseline) is not equivalent to [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline)\n as an inline-level box’s [baseline alignment preference](#baseline-alignment-preference) depends on [display](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display).\n (E.g., [inline-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#valdef-display-inline-block) uses its last baseline by default,\n while [inline-table](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#valdef-display-inline-table) uses its first baseline by default.)\n\n 4.3. \nDistributed Alignment: the [stretch](#valdef-align-content-stretch), [space-between](#valdef-align-content-space-between), [space-around](#valdef-align-content-space-around), and [space-evenly](#valdef-align-content-space-evenly) keywords[](#distribution-values)\n \nThe **distributed alignment** values are used by [justify-content](#propdef-justify-content) and [align-content](#propdef-align-content)\n to disperse a container’s extra space among its [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject).\n\n \n \n \n \n The [distributed alignment](#distributed-alignment) values\n \n \nWhen space cannot be distributed in this way,\n these values behave as their [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment).\n Each distribution value has an associated default fallback alignment.\n (A future level of this module may allow the fallback alignment to be specified explicitly.)\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-align-content-space-between\">space-between**\n \n \n \n The [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) are evenly distributed in the [alignment container](#alignment-container).\n The first alignment subject is placed flush with the start edge of the alignment container,\n the last alignment subject is placed flush with the end edge of the alignment container,\n and the remaining alignment subjects are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects is the same.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe default [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) for this value is safe flex-start.\n (For layout modes other than flex layout, [flex-start](#valdef-self-position-flex-start) is identical to [start](#valdef-self-position-start).)\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-align-content-space-around\">space-around**\n \n \n \n The [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) are

spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects,\n before the first alignment subject,\n and after the last alignment subject\n is the same.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe default [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) for this value is safe center.\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-align-content-stretch\">stretch**\n \n \n \n If the combined size of the [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) is less than the size of the [alignment container](#alignment-container),\n any auto-sized alignment subjects have their size increased equally (not proportionally),\n while still respecting the constraints imposed by [max-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-max-height)/[max-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-max-width)\n (or equivalent functionality),\n so that the combined size exactly fills the alignment container.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe default [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) for this value is [flex-start](#valdef-self-position-flex-start).\n (For layout modes other than flex layout, [flex-start](#valdef-self-position-flex-start) is identical to [start](#valdef-self-position-start).)\n\n \nNote: This `align-content/stretch` definition applies to the [content-distribution properties](#content-distribution-properties);\n the [self-alignment properties](#self-alignment-properties) [justify-self](#propdef-justify-self)/[align-self](#propdef-align-self) have their own [stretch](#valdef-justify-self-stretch) value,\n which can grow or shrink the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject)\n to ensure it exactly fits the [alignment container](#alignment-container).\n\n \n \nThese values are represented with the [<content-distribution>](#typedef-content-distribution) grammar term:\n\n```\n**<content-distribution>** = space-between [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) space-around

[safe](#valdef-overflow-position-safe) and [unsafe](#valdef-overflow-position-unsafe) keywords and scroll safety limits[](#overflow-values)\n \nIn some situations,\n aligning exactly as specified\n would cause the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) to overflow its [alignment container](#alignment-container),\n possibly causing data loss.\n For example, if the contents of a sidebar are unconditionally centered,\n items large enough to overflow it might extend beyond the viewport’s start edge,\n which can’t be scrolled to.\n\n \n [](#example-4fa66bd0)\n The figure below illustrates the difference in “safe” versus “unsafe” centering,\n using a column flexbox as an example:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n About\n Authoritarianism\n Blog\n \n \n \n \n About\n Authoritarianism\n Blog\n \n \n \n \n An example of \"safe\" (on the left)\n vs \"unsafe\" (on the right)\n centering,\n when the centered item is larger than its container.\n \n \n \nThe items in the figure on the left are centered unless they overflow,\n in which case all the overflow goes off the end edge,\n while those in the figure on the right are are all strictly centered,\n even if the one that is too long to fit overflows on both sides.\n\n \nIf the container was placed\n against the left edge of the page,\n the “safe” behavior would be more desirable,\n as the long item would be fully readable,\n rather than clipped by the left edge of the screen.\n In other circumstances,\n the “unsafe” centering behavior might be better,\n as it correctly centers all the items.\n\n \n \nTo control this situation,\n an **overflow alignment** mode can be explicitly specified.\n “Unsafe” alignment honors the specified alignment mode in overflow situations, even if it causes data loss,\n while “safe” alignment changes the alignment mode in overflow situations in an attempt to avoid data loss.\n The default behavior is to contain the alignment subject within the scrollable area,\n though at the time of writing this safety feature is not yet implemented.\n\n```\n**<overflow-position>** = unsafe [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) safe\n```\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-overflow-position-safe\">safe**\n \n \n If the size of the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) overflows the [alignment container](#alignment-container),\n the alignment subject is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were [flex-start](#valdef-self-position-flex-start).\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-overflow-position-unsafe\">unsafe**\n \n \n Regardless of the relative sizes of the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) and [alignment container](#alignment-container),\n the given alignment value is honored.\n\n \n (no value specified)\n \n \n If the [overflow alignment](#overflow-alignment) isn’t explicitly specified,\n the default overflow alignment is a blend of “safe” and “unsafe”.\n See [§ 4.4.1 Automatic Overflow Alignment Safety](#auto-safety) for details.\n \n \n 4.4.1. \nAutomatic Overflow Alignment Safety[](#auto-safety)\n \nIf no [overflow alignment](#overflow-alignment) mode is specified for a property,\n the default behavior lies somewhere between [safe](#valdef-overflow-position-safe) and [unsafe](#valdef-overflow-position-unsafe),\n and also varies by layout mode.\n\n 4.4.1.1. \nContent Distribution for Scroll Containers[](#auto-safety-scroll)\n \nThe default [overflow alignment](#overflow-alignment) behavior\n for [content distribution](#content-distribute) on [scroll containers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container) is [unsafe](#valdef-overflow-position-unsafe).\n Non-[normal](#valdef-justify-content-normal) values of the [content-distribution properties](#content-distribution-properties) instead\n alter the [scrollable overflow area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region) in order to allow access to the overflowing content.\n See [§ 5.3 Alignment Overflow and Scroll Containers](#overflow-scroll-position).\n\n 4.4.1.2. \nSelf-Alignment for Absolutely Positioned Boxes[](#auto-safety-position)\n \nFor [absolutely positioned](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#absolute-position) [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject)\n whose relevant [used](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) [self-alignment property](#self-alignment-properties) is not [normal](#valdef-justify-self-normal),\n the default [overflow alignment](#overflow-alignment) behavior is as follows:\n\n \n \n\n \n \nIf the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) fits within the [inset-modified containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#inset-modified-containing-block),\nalign as specified to the extent possible\nwithout overflowing the inset-modified containing block.\n\n \n \nOtherwise,\nif the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) fits within the overflow limit rect,\nalign the alignment subject such that\nit fully covers the [inset-modified containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#inset-modified-containing-block)\nand is otherwise aligned as specified to the extent possible\nwithout overflowing the overflow limit rect.\n\n \n \nOtherwise,\nstart-align the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) within the overflow limit rect\n(similar to safe).\n\n \n\n \nFor this purpose, the overflow limit rect is the bounding rectangle\n of the [alignment subject’s](#alignment-subject) [inset-modified containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#inset-modified-containing-block)\n and its [original containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#original-containing-block).\n However, because the [scrollable overflow area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region) of a [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container)\n can be extended to ensure the visibility of overflowing [absolutely positioned](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#absolute-position) boxes,\n if the original containing block is generated by a scroll container\n (and is not its [fixed containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-4/#fixed-containing-block)),\n the overflow limit rect is extended to infinity\n in any direction that does not extend into the [unreachable scrollable overflow region](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#unreachable-scrollable-overflow-region).\n\n \n \n(For [absolutely-positioned](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#absolute-position) [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) that fail the above condition,\n see [§ 4.4.1.3 All Other Alignment](#auto-safety-default).)\n\n \nNote: These rules constrain the position of the box to minimize overflow\n while honoring the specified alignment insofar as possible,\n and ensuring continuous behavior as the sizes of the boxes change.\n\n 4.4.1.3. \nAll Other Alignment[](#auto-safety-default)\n \nFor all other elements:\n\n \n\n \n \nIf the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) overflows its [alignment container](#alignment-container),\nalign as specified ([unsafe](#valdef-overflow-position-unsafe)).\n\n \n \nIf the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) would overflow\nthe [scrollable overflow area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region) of its nearest ancestor [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container),\n(thus extending into the “unscrollable” region),\nthen its overflow in that direction is limited\nby biasing any remaining overflow to the opposite side.\n\n \n\n \n[](#issue-6c9376ad) It may not be Web-compatible to implement the “smart” default behavior\n (though we hope so, and believe it to be likely),\n so UAs should pass any feedback on this point to the WG.\n UAs that have not implemented the “smart” default behavior\n must behave as [safe](#valdef-overflow-position-safe) for [align-content](#propdef-align-content) on

Containers[](#overflow-scroll-position)\n \nWhen the [content-distribution properties](#content-distribution-properties) are set\n on a [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container) with an overflowing [alignment subject](#alignment-subject),\n they reduce the clipping of the [unreachable scrollable overflow region](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#unreachable-scrollable-overflow-region)\n just enough to ensure that alignment subject can be scrolled\n into its [start](#valdef-self-position-start)-aligned position.\n\n [](#example-4f16a383)\n For example,\n if a scrollable flex container is set to [justify-content: flex-end](#propdef-justify-content)\n (or justify-content: flex-start with [flex-flow: row-reverse](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#propdef-flex-flow)),\n its [in-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#in-flow) content will be initially positioned\n to align the main-end edge of its content to the main-end edge of the flex container,\n and its content will appear to overflow its main-start edge.\n However, the viewer will be able to scroll up\n to view the overflowing in-flow content,\n just as if justify-content: flex-start had been specified.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Issue: Replace this image with a proper SVG.\n \n \n \nNote: The [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) is not necessarily\n identical to the [scrollable overflow area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region):\n content overflowing the alignment subject—​such as an [out-of-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#out-of-flow) box—​grows the scrollable overflow area but not the alignment subject.\n Thus an [end](#valdef-self-position-end)-aligned [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container)\n might not be initially scrolled all the way to the bottom,\n and positioned content can still be clipped\n if it is further into the [unreachable scrollable overflow region](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#unreachable-scrollable-overflow-region)\n than the [in-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#in-flow) content forming the alignment subject.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Overflow is not part of the [alignment subject](#alignment-subject),\n even for a [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container).\n\n \n Replace this image too.\n\n \n \n \nNote: The presence of scrollbars can change\n the size of the [scroll container’s](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container) [content box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#content-box)—​and thus the size of the [alignment container](#alignment-container)\n and/or [alignment subject](#alignment-subject).\n\n 5.4. \nBaseline Content-Alignment[](#baseline-align-content)\n \nThe content of boxes participating in row-like layout contexts ([shared alignment contexts](#shared-alignment-context))\n can be baseline-aligned to each other.\n **Baseline content-alignment** effectively increases the padding on the box\n to align the [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline) of its contents\n with that of other baseline-aligned boxes in its [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group).\n\n \n[Baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment) can only apply if the [align-content](#propdef-align-content) axis\n is parallel with the box’s [block axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-axis)\n (i.e. it does not apply to “column” [flex containers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-container));\n otherwise the [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment) is used.\n\n \nThe set of boxes that participate in [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n depends on the layout model:\n\n \n Table Cells:\n \n \n \n A ([non-replaced](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#non-replaced)) table cell participates in\n first/last [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n in its startmost/endmost row\n if its inline axis is parallel to that of the table itself and\n its computed [align-content](#propdef-align-content) is [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline) ([last baseline](#valdef-justify-self-last-baseline)).\n\n \nNote: [Baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n of cells sharing a column is not supported;\n however this may be added in a future level\n if there is sufficient demand and implementer interest.\n\n Flex Items:\n \n \n A [non-replaced](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#non-replaced) [flex item](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-item) participates in\n first/last [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n in its flex line if\n its computed [align-content](#propdef-align-content) is [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline)/[last baseline](#valdef-justify-self-last-baseline)\n and its [inline axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-axis) is parallel to the [main axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#main-axis).\n\n \n Grid Items:\n \n \n A [non-replaced](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#non-replaced) [grid item](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-item) participates in\n first/last [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n in its startmost/endmost row or column\n (whichever is parallel to its [inline axis](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-axis))\n and if its computed [align-content](#propdef-align-content) is [first baseline](#valdef-justify-self-first-baseline)/[last baseline](#valdef-justify-self-last-baseline).\n \n \n \nAdditionally,\n in order to participate in [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment)\n it must also have a **coordinated self-alignment preference**,\n to guarantee that the box lines up the relevant edge\n with other boxes in its [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group).\n That is, the box’s [start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#start) ([end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#end)) [margin edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#margin-edge)\n must be intended to align—​and actually align—​to the corresponding [edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#box-box-edge) of its [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#containing-block)\n when its [baseline alignment preference](#baseline-alignment-preference) is “first” (“last”).\n It otherwise takes its [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment).\n\n \n When is a self-alignment preference coordinated?\n \nA box’s [start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#start) [margin edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#margin-edge) is aligned\n to the corresponding edge of its [containing

modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode)\n that exist in internationalized modern CSS.\n\n \nA **baseline set** is\n a set of baselines (alphabetic, central, etc.)\n associated with a common baseline table.\n Typically, a typesetting tradition will use only one of these,\n but different writing systems use different baselines,\n and mixing writing systems can result in using more than one\n within a single line.\n Refer to [CSS Writing Modes 3 § 4.1 Introduction to Baselines](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#intro-baselines)\n for more information on baselines

nominally corresponds to the [baseline set](#baseline-set) of\n the first/last line of text within the box.\n The **alignment baseline**,\n which is the baseline used to align the box in its [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context),\n is one of the baselines in its baseline set,\n usually the dominant baseline associated with the shared alignment context.\n (See the [dominant-baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-dominant-baseline) and [alignment-baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-alignment-baseline) properties in [[CSS-INLINE-3]](#biblio-css-inline-3).)\n\n \nThe first and last [baseline sets](#baseline-set) of a box\n are determined differently based on the layout model, as follows:\n\n \n line box\n \n \n The first/last [baseline set](#baseline-set) of a line box\n is [generated](#generate-baselines) from the dominant baseline\n and the font settings of its [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box).\n\n \n block containers\n \n \n \n The first/last [baseline set](#baseline-set) of a [block container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#block-container)\n is taken from the first/last [in-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#in-flow) line box in the block container\n or the first/last in-flow block-level child in the block container\n that contributes a set of first/last baselines,\n whichever comes first/last.\n If there is no such line box or child,\n then the block container has no baseline set.\n\n \nHowever, for legacy reasons\n if its [baseline-source](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-baseline-source) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#valdef-baseline-source-auto) (the [initial value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#initial-value))\n a

multi-column containers\n \n \n \n The first [baseline set](#baseline-set) of a [multi-column container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1/#multi-column-container)\n is the first baseline set of the [column](https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-terms-and-definitions-colun) or [multi-column spanner](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-2/#multi-column-spanner)\n with the highest ([block-start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-start)–most) baseline\n corresponding to the multi-column container’s [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline).\n If there is no such line box or child,\n then the multi-column container has no first baseline set.\n\n \nThe last [baseline set](#baseline-set) is analogous,\n but uses the last baseline set\n and lowest ([block-end](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-end)–most) baseline.\n\n tables\n \n \n \n The first/last [baseline set](#baseline-set) of a table box\n is the first/last baseline set of

participates in [baseline alignment](#baseline-alignment)\n has no [baseline set](#baseline-set),\n then its [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline) is [synthesized](#synthesize-baseline)\n according to the rules of the [formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#formatting-context) in which it participates.\n To **synthesize baselines** from a rectangle (or two parallel lines),\n synthesize the alphabetic baseline from the [line-under](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#line-under) line,\n and the central baseline by averaging the positions of the two edges or lines.\n See [CSS Inline Layout 3 § A Synthesizing Alignment Metrics](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#baseline-synthesis) for rules on synthesizing additional baselines.\n\n \nNote: The edges used to [synthesize](#synthesize-baseline) baselines from a box\n depend on their [formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#formatting-context):\n inline-level boxes synthesize from their margin edges [[CSS-INLINE-3]](#biblio-css-inline-3),\n table cells synthesize from their content edges [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2),\n and grid and flex items synthesize from their border edges [[CSS-GRID-1]](#biblio-css-grid-1) [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]](#biblio-css-flexbox-1).\n\n \nIn general, the [writing mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode) of the box, shape, or other object being aligned\n is used to determine the [line-under](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#line-under) and [line-over](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#line-over) edges for synthesis.\n However, when that writing mode’s\n [block flow direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-flow-direction) is parallel\n to the axis of the [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context),\n an axis-compatible writing mode must be assumed:\n\n \n\n \n \nIf the box establishing the [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context)\nhas a [block flow direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-flow-direction) that is orthogonal to the axis of the alignment context,\nuse its [writing mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode).\n\n \n \nOtherwise:\n\n \n\n \n \nIf the box’s own [writing mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode) is vertical,\nassume [horizontal-tb](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-writing-mode-horizontal-tb).\n\n \n \nIf the box’s own [writing mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode) is horizontal,\nassume [vertical-lr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-lr) if [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction) is [ltr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-ltr)\nand [vertical-rl](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-writing-mode-vertical-rl) if direction is [rtl](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-rtl).\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFor the purposes of finding the baselines of a box,\n it and all its [in-flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#in-flow) descendants with a scrolling mechanism (see the [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-overflow) property)\n must be considered as if scrolled to their initial scroll position.\n Additionally,\n if the position of a [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container)’s first/last baseline\n is outside its border edge,\n that baseline’s position is clamped to the border edge.\n\n 9.2. \nBaseline Alignment Grouping[](#baseline-terms)\n \nA **baseline-sharing group**\n is composed of boxes that participate in baseline alignment together.\n This is possible only if they both:\n\n \n\n Share an [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context) along an axis perpendicular to the axis they’re being baseline-aligned in.\n (For example, grid items with [align-self: baseline](#propdef-align-self) are baseline-aligning along the grid’s block axis,\n and therefore participate with other items in their row.)\n \n Have [compatible baseline alignment preferences](#compatible-baseline-alignment-preferences)\n (i.e., the baselines that want to align are on the same side of the alignment context).\n \n \n\n \nNote: Boxes participating in [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment) and\n boxes participating in [baseline self-alignment](#baseline-self-alignment)\n can be part of the same [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group),\n and can thus align to each other.\n The difference between the two methods\n is in where extra space is inserted to perform the alignment\n (inside or outside the box’s own border).\n\n \nBoxes share an **alignment context**,\n along a particular axis,\n and established by a particular box,\n when they are:\n\n \n\n table cells in the same row, along the table’s row (inline) axis, established by the row box\n \n grid items in the same row, along the grid’s row (inline) axis, established by the [grid container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-container)\n \n grid items in the same column, along the grid’s column (block) axis, established by the [grid container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-container)\n \n flex items in the same flex line, along the flex container’s main axis, established by the [flex container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-container)\n \n \n\n \nNote: Conceptually,\n the inline-level boxes in a line box also share a self-alignment context\n and participate in a baseline-sharing group;\n however they only baseline-align in response to the [vertical-align](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align) property,\n not any of the properties defined in this module.\n See [[CSS-INLINE-3]](#biblio-css-inline-3).\n\n \nIf a box spans multiple [shared alignment contexts](#shared-alignment-context),\n then it participates in first/last baseline alignment\n within its start-most/end-most shared alignment context along that axis.\n For example, a table cell spanning three rows\n participates in [first-baseline alignment](#first-baseline-alignment)\n with the table cells in the first row that it spans,\n or alternatively in [last-baseline alignment](#last-baseline-alignment)\n with the table cells in the last row that it spans.\n\n \nThe [baseline alignment preferences](#baseline-alignment-preference) of two boxes in a [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group) are **compatible** if they have:\n\n \n\n \n \nthe same [block flow direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-flow-direction) and same [baseline alignment preference](#baseline-alignment-preference)\n\n \n \nopposite [block flow direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#block-flow-direction) and opposite [baseline alignment preference](#baseline-alignment-preference)\n\n \n\n 9.3. \nAligning Boxes by Baseline[](#align-by-baseline)\n \nGiven a set of [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) and their baselines\n that all belong to a single [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group),\n the alignment subjects are baseline-aligned as follows:\n\n \n\n \n \nGenerate the [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group)’s baseline table\nfrom the [first available font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#first-available-font) of the group’s [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context)\nand overlay also the mirror of this baseline table by aligning their central baselines.\nThese are the baseline “grids” to which the [alignment subjects](#alignment-subject) will align.\n\n \n \nAlign each [alignment subject](#alignment-subject) by its specified [alignment baseline](#alignment-baseline)\nto the group’s baseline table\nor its mirror, whichever matches the alignment subject’s [line orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#line-orientation).\nUnless otherwise specified (e.g. via the [alignment-baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#propdef-alignment-baseline) property),\nthe alignment baseline is the [dominant baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#dominant-baseline) of the [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context).\n\n \n \nPosition the aligned [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group) within the [alignment container](#alignment-container)\naccording to its [fallback alignment](#fallback-alignment).\nThe fallback alignment of a baseline-sharing group\nis the fallback alignment of its items\nas resolved to [physical directions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#physical-direction).\n\n \n \nFor first/last [baseline content-alignment](#baseline-content-alignment),\nthen add the minimum necessary extra space\nbetween the [alignment container’s](#alignment-container) start/end content edge\nand the [alignment subject’s](#alignment-subject) edge\nto align the start/end margin edges of all the alignment containers\nin the [alignment context](#shared-alignment-context)\nwhile maintaining baseline alignment within the [baseline-sharing group](#baseline-sharing-group).",
