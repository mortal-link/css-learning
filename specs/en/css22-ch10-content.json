      "content": "The position and size of an element's box(es) are sometimes\ncalculated relative to a certain rectangle, called the containing\nblock of the element. The containing block of an element\nis defined as follows:\n\n- The containing block in which the [root\nelement](conform.html#root) lives is a rectangle called the initial containing block. For continuous\nmedia, it has the dimensions of the [viewport](visuren.html#viewport) and is anchored at the\ncanvas origin; it is the [page area](page.html#page-area)\nfor paged media. The 'direction' property of the initial\ncontaining block is the same as for the root element.\n\n- For other elements, if the element's position is 'relative' or 'static',\nthe containing block is formed by the content edge of the nearest\nancestor box that is a [block\ncontainer](visuren.html#block-boxes) or which establishes a formatting context.\n\n- If the element has 'position: fixed', the containing block is\nestablished by the [viewport](visuren.html#viewport)\nin the case of continuous media or the page area in the case of paged media.\n\n- If the element has 'position: absolute', the containing block is\nestablished by the nearest ancestor with a ['position'](visuren.html#propdef-position) of 'absolute', 'relative'\nor 'fixed', in the following way:\n\nIn the case that the ancestor is an inline element, the containing\nblock is the bounding box around the padding boxes of the first and\nthe last inline boxes\ngenerated for that element. In CSS 2.2, if the inline\nelement is split\nacross multiple lines, the containing block is undefined.\n\n- Otherwise, the containing block\nis formed by the [padding edge](box.html#padding-edge) of\n\nthe ancestor.\n\nIf there is no such ancestor, the containing block is the initial\ncontaining block.\n\nIn paged media, an absolutely positioned element is positioned\nrelative to its containing block ignoring any page breaks (as if the\ndocument were continuous). The element may subsequently be broken over\nseveral pages.\n\nFor absolutely positioned content that resolves to a position on a\npage other than the page being laid out (the current page), or\nresolves to a position on the current page which has already been\nrendered for printing, printers may place the content\n\non another location on the current page,\non a subsequent page, or\nmay omit it.\n\nNote that a\nblock-level element that is split over several pages may have a different\nwidth on each page and that there may be device-specific limits.\n\nExample(s):\n\nWith no positioning, the containing blocks (C.B.) in the\nfollowing document:\n\n```\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">\n<HTML>\n <HEAD>\n <TITLE>Illustration of containing blocks</TITLE>\n </HEAD>\n <BODY id=\"body\">\n <DIV id=\"div1\">\n <P id=\"p1\">This is text in the first paragraph...</P>\n <P id=\"p2\">This is text <EM id=\"em1\"> in the \n <STRONG id=\"strong1\">second</STRONG> paragraph.</EM></P>\n </DIV>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n```\n\nare established as follows:\n\nFor box generated by \nC.B. is established by\nhtmlinitial C.B. (UA-dependent)\nbodyhtml\ndiv1body\np1div1\np2div1\nem1p2\nstrong1p2\n\nIf we position \"div1\":\n\n```\n\n #div1 { position: absolute; left: 50px; top: 50px }\n\n```\n\nits containing block is no longer \"body\"; it becomes\nthe initial containing block (since there are no\nother positioned ancestor boxes).\n\nIf we position \"em1\" as well:\n\n```\n\n #div1 { position: absolute; left: 50px; top: 50px }\n #em1 { position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 100px }\n\n```\n\nthe table of containing blocks becomes:\n\nFor box generated by\nC.B. is established by\nhtmlinitial C.B. (UA-dependent)\nbodyhtml\ndiv1initial C.B.\np1div1\np2div1\nem1div1\nstrong1em1\n\nBy positioning \"em1\", its containing block becomes\nthe nearest positioned ancestor box (i.e., that generated\nby \"div1\").",

(Note that due to the rules\nin [section 9.7](visuren.html#dis-pos-flo) this\nhypothetical calculation might require also assuming a different\ncomputed value for 'display'.)\n\n- The static position for 'left' is the distance from the left edge\nof the containing block to the left margin edge of a hypothetical box\nthat would have been the first box of the element if its ['position'](visuren.html#propdef-position) property had been 'static'\nand ['float'](visuren.html#propdef-float) had been 'none'. The\nvalue is negative if the hypothetical\nbox is to the left of the containing block.\n\n- The static position for 'right' is the distance from the right\nedge of the containing block to the right margin edge of the same\nhypothetical box as above. The value is positive if the hypothetical\nbox is to the left of the containing block's edge.\n\nBut rather than actually calculating the dimensions of that\nhypothetical box, user agents are free to make a guess at its probable\nposition.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating the static position, the containing\nblock of fixed positioned elements is the initial containing block\ninstead of the viewport, and all scrollable boxes should be assumed to\nbe scrolled to their origin.\n\nThe constraint that determines the used values for these\nelements is:\n\n \n \n'left' + 'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width'\n+ 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + 'right' = width\n of containing block \n\n \n \n\nIf all three of 'left', 'width', and 'right' are 'auto': First set\nany 'auto' values for 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' to 0.

      "content": "CSS assumes that every font has font metrics that specify a\ncharacteristic height above the baseline and a depth below it. In this\nsection we use A to mean that height (for a given font at a\ngiven size) and D the depth. We also define AD =\nA + D, the distance from the top to the\nbottom. (See the note below for [how to find\nA and D for TrueType and OpenType fonts.](#sTypoAscender))\nNote that these are metrics of the font as a whole and need not\ncorrespond to the ascender and descender of any individual glyph.\n\nUser agent must align the glyphs in a non-replaced inline box to\neach other by their relevant baselines. Then, for\neach glyph, determine the A and D. Note that\nglyphs in a single element may come from different fonts and thus need\nnot all have the same A and D. If the inline box\ncontains no glyphs at all, it is considered to contain a [strut](#strut) (an invisible glyph of zero width) with the\nA and D of the element's first available font.\n\nStill for each glyph, determine the leading L to add,\nwhere L = ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) - AD. Half\nthe leading is added above A and the other half below\nD, giving the glyph and its leading a total height above\nthe baseline of A' = A + L/2 and a\ntotal depth of D' = D + L/2.\n\nNote. L may be negative.\n\nThe height of the inline box encloses all\nglyphs and their half-leading on each side and is thus exactly\n'line-height'. Boxes of\nchild elements do not influence this height.\n\nAlthough margins, borders, and padding of non-replaced elements do\nnot enter into the line box calculation, they are still rendered\naround inline boxes. This means that if the height specified by ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) is less than the\ncontent height of contained boxes, backgrounds and colors of padding\nand borders may \"bleed\" into adjoining line boxes. User agents should\nrender the boxes in document order. This will cause the borders on\nsubsequent lines to paint over the borders and text of previous lines.\n\nNote. CSS 2.2 does not define\nwhat the content area of an inline box is (see [10.6.1](#inline-non-replaced) above) and thus different UAs\nmay draw the backgrounds and borders in different places.\n\nNote. It is\nrecommended that implementations that use OpenType or TrueType fonts\nuse the metrics \"sTypoAscender\" and \"sTypoDescender\" from the font's\nOS/2 table for A and D (after scaling to the current element's font\nsize). In the absence of these metrics, the \"Ascent\" and \"Descent\"\nmetrics from the HHEA table should be used.\n\n \n \n Name:\n **line-height**Value:normal | [<number>](syndata.html#value-def-number) | [<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length) | [<percentage>](syndata.html#value-def-percentage) | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:normal\nApplies to:all elements\nInherited:yes\nPercentages:refer to the font size of the element itself\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:for [<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length) and [<percentage>](syndata.html#value-def-percentage) the absolute value; otherwise as specified\n\nOn a [block container element](visuren.html#block-boxes)\nwhose content\nis composed of [inline-level](visuren.html#inline-level)\nelements, 'line-height' specifies the minimal height of line boxes\nwithin the element. The minimum height consists of a minimum height above\nthe baseline and a minimum depth below it, exactly as if each\nline box starts with a zero-width inline box with the\nelement's font and line height properties. We call that imaginary\nbox a \"strut.\" (The name is inspired by TeX.).\n\nThe height and depth of the font above and below the baseline are\nassumed to be metrics that are contained in the font. (For more\ndetails, see CSS level 3.)\n\nOn a non-replaced [inline](visuren.html#inline-boxes) element, 'line-height'\nspecifies the height that is used in the calculation of the line box\nheight.\n\nValues for this property have the following meanings:\n\nnormal \nTells user agents to set the used\nvalue to a \"reasonable\" value based on the font of the element. The\nvalue has the same meaning as [<number>](syndata.html#value-def-number). We recommend a\nused value for 'normal' between 1.0 to 1.2. The [computed value](cascade.html#computed-value) is 'normal'.\n\n[<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length)\n\nThe specified length is used in the calculation of the line box\nheight. Negative values are illegal.\n\n[<number>](syndata.html#value-def-number)\n\nThe used value of the property is this number multiplied by the\nelement's font size. Negative values are illegal. The [computed value](cascade.html#computed-value) is the same as\nthe specified value.\n\n[<percentage>](syndata.html#value-def-percentage)\n\nThe [computed value](cascade.html#computed-value) of the\nproperty is this percentage multiplied by the element's \ncomputed font size. Negative values are illegal.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe three rules in the example below have the same resultant line height:\n\n```\n\ndiv { line-height: 1.2; font-size: 10pt } /* number */\ndiv { line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 10pt } /* length */\ndiv { line-height: 120%; font-size: 10pt } /* percentage */\n\n```\n\nWhen an element contains text that is rendered\nin more than one font, user agents may determine the 'normal' ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) value according to\nthe largest font size.\n\nNote. When there is only one value of ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) for all inline\nboxes in a block container box and they are all in the same font (and\nthere are no replaced elements, inline-block\nelements, etc.), the above will ensure that\nbaselines of successive lines are exactly ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) apart. This is\nimportant when columns of text in different fonts have to be aligned,\nfor example in a table.\n\n \n \n Name:\n **vertical-align**Value:baseline | sub | super | top | text-top | middle | \n bottom | text-bottom | [<percentage>](syndata.html#value-def-percentage) | [<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length) | [inherit](cascade.html#value-def-inherit)\nInitial:baseline\nApplies to:inline-level and 'table-cell' elements\nInherited:no\nPercentages:refer to the 'line-height' of the element itself\nMedia:[visual](media.html#visual-media-group)\nComputed value:for [<percentage>](syndata.html#value-def-percentage) and [<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length) the absolute length, otherwise as specified\n\nThis property affects the vertical positioning inside a line box of\nthe boxes generated by an inline-level element.\n\n \n\nNote. Values of this property have\ndifferent meanings in the context of tables.\nPlease consult the section on [\ntable height algorithms](tables.html#height-layout) for details.\n\nThe following values only have meaning with respect to a parent\ninline element, or to the [strut](#strut) of a parent\nblock container element.\n\nIn the following definitions, for inline non-replaced elements, the\nbox used for alignment is the box whose height is the 'line-height'\n(containing the box's glyphs and the half-leading on each side, see [above](#inline-box-height)). For all other elements, the box\nused for alignment is the margin box.\n\n baseline\n Align the baseline of the box with the baseline of\n the parent box. If the box does not have a baseline, align the\n bottom margin edge with the parent's baseline.\n middle\n Align the vertical midpoint of the box with the baseline\n of the parent box plus half the x-height of the parent.\n sub\n Lower the baseline of the box to the proper position for\n subscripts of the parent's box. (This value has no effect on the\n font size of the element's text.)\n super\n Raise the baseline of the box to the proper position for\n superscripts of the parent's box. (This value has no effect on the\n font size of the element's text.)\n text-top\n Align the top of the box with the top of the parent's content\n area (see [10.6.1](#inline-non-replaced)).\n text-bottom\n Align the bottom of the box with the bottom of the parent's\n content area (see [10.6.1](#inline-non-replaced)).\n [<percentage>\n ](syndata.html#value-def-percentage)\n Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) the box\n by this distance (a percentage of the ['line-height'](visudet.html#propdef-line-height) value).\n The value '0%' means the same as 'baseline'.\n [<length>\n ](syndata.html#value-def-length)\n Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) the box\n by this distance.\n The value '0cm' means the same as 'baseline'.\n \n\nThe following values align the element relative to the line box.\nSince the element may have children aligned relative to it (which in\nturn may have descendants aligned relative to them), these values use\nthe bounds of the aligned subtree. The **aligned subtree** of\nan inline element contains that element and the aligned subtrees of\nall children inline elements whose computed 'vertical-align' value is\nnot 'top' or 'bottom'. The top of the aligned subtree is the highest\nof the tops of the boxes in the subtree, and the bottom is analogous.\n\n top\n Align the top of the aligned subtree with the top of the line box.\n bottom\n Align the bottom of the aligned subtree with the bottom of the\n line box.\n\nThe baseline of an 'inline-table' is the baseline of the first row\nof the table.\n\nThe baseline of an 'inline-block' is the baseline of its last line\nbox in the normal flow, unless it has either no in-flow line boxes or\nif its 'overflow' property has a computed value other than 'visible',\nin which case the baseline is the bottom margin edge.\n\n[previous](visuren.html) \n[next](visufx.html) \n[contents](Overview.html#minitoc) \n[properties](propidx.html) \n[index](indexlist.html)",
