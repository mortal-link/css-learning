      "content": "CSS defines a finite set of parameters,\r\n called **properties**,\r\n that direct the rendering of a document.\r\n Each [property](#css-property) has a name\r\n (e.g., [color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-color), [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size), or [border-style](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-style)),\r\n a value space\r\n (e.g., [<color>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#typedef-color), [<length-percentage>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-length-percentage), [ solid | dashed | dotted | … ]),\r\n and a defined behavior on the rendering of the document.\r\n Properties values are assigned to various parts of the document\r\n via [property declarations](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#css-property-declarations),\r\n which assign the property a value\r\n (e.g. [red](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-red), 12pt, [dotted](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#valdef-line-style-dotted))\r\n for the associated element or box.\n\r\n \nOne of the fundamental design principles of CSS is [cascading](#cascade),\r\n which allows several style sheets to influence the presentation of a document.\r\n When different declarations try to set a value for the same element/property combination,\r\n the conflicts must somehow be resolved.\n\r\n \nThe opposite problem arises when no declarations try to set a value for an element/property combination.\r\n In this case, a value is be found by way of [inheritance](#inheritance) or by looking at the property’s [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n \nThe [cascading](#cascade) and [defaulting](#defaulting) process takes a set of declarations as input,\r\n and outputs a [specified value](#specified-value) for each property on each element.\n\r\n \nThe rules for finding the specified value for all properties on all elements in the document are described in this specification.\r\n The rules for finding the specified values in the page context and its margin boxes are described in [[css-page-3]](#biblio-css-page-3).\n\r\n 1.1. Module Interactions[](#placement)\r\n \nThis section is normative.\n\r\n \nThis module replaces and extends\r\n the rules for assigning property values, cascading, and inheritance defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) chapter 6.\n\r\n \nOther CSS modules may expand the definitions of some of the syntax and features defined here.\r\n For example, the Media Queries Level 4 specification,\r\n when combined with this module, expands the definition of\r\n the [<media-query>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query) value type as used in this specification.\n\r\n \nFor the purpose of this specification, [text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#text-nodes) are treated as [element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#elements) children of their associated element,\r\n and possess the full set of properties;\r\n since they cannot be targeted by selectors\r\n all of their computed values are assigned by [defaulting](#defaulting).",

      "content": "The **@import** rule allows users to import style rules from other style sheets.\r\n If an [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rule refers to a valid stylesheet,\r\n user agents must treat the contents of the stylesheet as if they were written in place of the @import rule,\r\n with two exceptions:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nIf a feature\r\n(such as the @namespace rule) explicitly defines that it only applies to a particular stylesheet,\r\nand not any imported ones,\r\nthen it doesn’t apply to the imported stylesheet.\n\r\n \r\n \nIf a feature relies on the relative ordering of two or more constructs in a stylesheet\r\n(such as the requirement that @namespace rules must not have any other rules other than [@import](#at-ruledef-import) preceding it),\r\nit only applies between constructs in the same stylesheet.\n\r\n \n\r\n \n[](#example-d425da12) For example, declarations in style rules from imported stylesheets interact with the cascade\r\n as if they were written literally into the stylesheet at the point of the [@import](#at-ruledef-import). \n\r\n \nAny [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules must precede all other valid at-rules and style rules in a style sheet\r\n (ignoring [@charset](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#at-ruledef-charset) and empty [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) definitions)\r\n and must not have any other valid at-rules or style rules between it and previous @import rules,\r\n or else the @import rule is invalid.\r\n The syntax of @import is:\n\r\n\n```\n@import [ [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) ]\r\n [ layer [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) layer([<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name)) ][?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt)\r\n [ supports( [ [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) <declaration> ] ) ][?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt)\r\n [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list)[?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt) ;\n```\n\r\n \nwhere:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nthe [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) or [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) gives the URL of the style sheet to be imported.\n\r\n \r\n \nthe optional layer keyword or layer() function\r\nassigns the contents of the style sheet\r\ninto its own anonymous [cascade layer](#cascade-layers) or into the named cascade layer.\n\r\n \nThe layer is added to the [layer order](#layer-ordering) even if the import fails to load the stylesheet,\r\nbut is subject to any [import conditions](#import-conditions) (just as if declared by an [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rule wrapped\r\nin the appropriate [conditional group rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#conditional-group-rule)).\n\r\n \r\n \nthe optional [[<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition)|<declaration>] and [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list) (collectively, the **import conditions**)\r\nstate the conditions under which it applies.\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n [](#example-05c74581) The following [conditional @import rule](#conditional-import) only loads the style sheet when the UA [supports](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-3/#support-definition) [display: flex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display),\r\n and only applies the style sheet on a [handheld](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html#media-types) device\r\n with a [maximum viewport width](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#width) of 400px. \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"narrow.css\") supports(display: flex) handheld and (max-width: 400px);\n```\n\r\n \r\n \r\n [](#example-2061dccb) The following layer imports load the style sheets into\r\n the framework.component layer, and an un-named layer, respectively: \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"tabs.css\") layer(framework.component);\r\n@import url(\"override.css\") layer();\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nIf a [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) is provided,\r\n it must be interpreted as a [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) with the same value.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-da2e49cb) The following lines are equivalent in meaning\r\n and illustrate both [@import](#at-ruledef-import) syntaxes\r\n (one with [url()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#funcdef-url) and one with a bare string): \r\n\n```\n@import \"mystyle.css\";\r\n@import url(\"mystyle.css\");\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n 2.1. Conditional [@import](#at-ruledef-import) Rules[](#conditional-import)\r\n \nThe [import conditions](#import-conditions) allow the import to be media– or feature-support–dependent.\r\n In the absence of any import conditions, the import is unconditional.\r\n (Specifying all for the [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list) has the same effect.)\r\n If the import conditions do not match,\r\n the rules in the imported stylesheet do not apply,\r\n exactly as if the imported stylesheet were wrapped in [@media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-media) and/or [@supports](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-supports) blocks with the given conditions.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-5fa651f3) The following rules illustrate how [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules can be made media-dependent: \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"fineprint.css\") print;\r\n@import url(\"bluish.css\") projection, tv;\r\n@import url(\"narrow.css\") handheld and (max-width: 400px);\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nUser agents may therefore avoid fetching a conditional import\r\n as long as the [import conditions](#import-conditions) do not match.\r\n Additionally, if a [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition) blocks the application of the imported style sheet,\r\n the UA must not fetch the style sheet (unless it is loaded through some other link)\r\n and must return null for the import rule’s CSSImportRule.styleSheet value\r\n (even if it is loaded through some other link).\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-c6c2c0ee) The following rule illustrates how an author can provide fallback rules for legacy user agents\r\n without impacting network performance on newer user agents: \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"fallback-layout.css\") supports(not (display: flex));\r\n@supports (display: flex) {\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nThe [import conditions](#import-conditions) are given by [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list), which is parsed and interpreted as a [media query list](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#media-query-list),\r\n and [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition), is parsed and interpreted as a [[supports query]].\r\n If a <declaration> is given in place of a <supports-condition>,\r\n it must be interpreted as a [<supports-decl>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-decl) (i.e. the extra set of parentheses is implied)\r\n and treated as a <supports-condition>.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-75806df4) For example, the following two lines are equivalent: \r\n\n```\n@import \"mystyle.css\" supports(display: flex);\r\n@import \"mystyle.css\" supports((display: flex));\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nThe evaluation and full syntax of the [import conditions](#import-conditions) are defined by the [Media Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries/) [[MEDIAQ]](#biblio-mediaq) and [CSS Conditional Rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional/) [[CSS-CONDITIONAL-3]](#biblio-css-conditional-3) specifications.\n\r\n 2.2. Processing Stylesheet Imports[](#import-processing)\r\n \nWhen the same style sheet is imported or linked to a document in multiple places,\r\n user agents must process (or act as though they do) each link\r\n as though the link were to an independent style sheet.\n\r\n \nNote: This does not place any requirements on resource fetching,\r\n only how the style sheet is reflected in the CSSOM and used in specs such as this one.\r\n Assuming appropriate caching,\r\n it is perfectly appropriate for a UA to fetch a style sheet only once,\r\n even though it’s linked or imported multiple times.\n\r\n \nThe [cascade origin](#origin) of an imported style sheet is the cascade origin of the style sheet that imported it.\n\r\n \nThe [environment encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#environment-encoding) of an imported style sheet is the encoding of the style sheet that imported it. [[css-syntax-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3)\n\r\n 2.3. Content-Type of CSS Style Sheets[](#content-type)\r\n \nThe processing of imported style sheets depends on the actual type of the linked resource:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nIf the resource does not have [Content-Type metadata](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#content-type),\r\nthe type is treated as `text/css`.\n\r\n \r\n \nIf the host document is in [quirks mode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-quirks),\r\nand the host document’s origin is [same origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#same-origin) with the linked resource [response’s](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response) [URL’s](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response-url) origin,\r\nthe type is treated as `text/css`.\n\r\n \r\n \nOtherwise, the type is determined from its [Content-Type metadata](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#content-type).\n\r\n \n\r\n \nIf the linked resource’s type is `text/css`,\r\n it must be interpreted as a CSS style sheet.\r\n Otherwise, it must be interpreted as a network error.",

      "heading": "3.  Shorthand Properties",
      "content": "Some properties are **shorthand properties**,\r\n meaning that they allow authors to specify the values of several properties with a single property.\r\n A [shorthand property](#shorthand-property) sets all of its **longhand sub-properties**,\r\n exactly as if expanded in place.\n\r\n \nWhen values are omitted from a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) form,\r\n unless otherwise defined,\r\n each “missing” [sub-property](#longhand) is assigned its [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n \r\n This means that a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property declaration always sets all of its [sub-properties](#longhand),\r\n even those that are not explicitly set.\r\n Carelessly used, this might result in inadvertently resetting some sub-properties.\r\n Carefully used, a shorthand can guarantee a “blank slate”\r\n by resetting sub-properties inadvertently cascaded from other sources. \r\n \nFor example, writing [background: green](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background) rather than [background-color: green](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-color) ensures that the background color overrides any earlier declarations\r\n that might have set the background to an image with [background-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-image).\n\r\n \r\n \r\n [](#example-8762997a) For example, the CSS Level 1 [font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font) property\r\n is a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property for setting [font-style](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-style), [font-variant](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-variant), [font-weight](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-weight), [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size), [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height), and [font-family](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-family) all at once.\r\n The multiple declarations of this example: \r\n\n```\nh1 {\r\n font-weight: bold;\r\n font-size: 12pt;\r\n line-height: 14pt;\r\n font-family: Helvetica;\r\n font-variant: normal;\r\n font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \ncan therefore be rewritten as\n\r\n\n```\nh1 { font: bold 12pt/14pt Helvetica }\n```\n\r\n \nAs more [font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font) [sub-properties](#longhand) are introduced into CSS,\r\n the shorthand declaration resets those to their initial values as well.\n\r\n \r\n \nIn some cases, a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) might have different syntax\r\n or special keywords\r\n that don’t directly correspond to values of its [sub-properties](#longhand).\r\n (In such cases, the shorthand will explicitly define the expansion of its values.)\n\r\n \nIn other cases, a property might be a **reset-only sub-property** of the shorthand:\r\n Like other [sub-properties](#longhand), it is reset to its initial value by the shorthand when unspecified,\r\n but the shorthand might not include syntax to set the sub-property to any of its other values. For example, the [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border) shorthand resets [border-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-image) to its initial value of none,\r\n but has no syntax to set it to anything else. [[css-backgrounds-3]](#biblio-css-backgrounds-3)\n\r\n \nIf a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) is specified as one of the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#common-keywords) [[css-values-3]](#biblio-css-values-3),\r\n it sets all of its [sub-properties](#longhand) to that keyword,\r\n including any that are [reset-only sub-properties](#reset-only-sub-property).\r\n (Note that these keywords cannot be combined with other values in a single declaration, not even in a shorthand.)\n\r\n \nDeclaring a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property to be !important is equivalent to declaring all of its [sub-properties](#longhand) to be !important.\n\r\n 3.1. Property Aliasing[](#aliasing)\r\n \nProperties sometimes change names after being supported for a while,\r\n such as vendor-prefixed properties being standardized.\r\n The original name still needs to be supported for compatibility reasons,\r\n but the new name is preferred.\r\n To accomplish this, CSS defines two different ways of “aliasing” old syntax to new syntax.\n\r\n \r\n **legacy name aliases** \r\n \r\n When the old property’s value syntax is identical\r\n to that of the new property,\r\n the two names are aliased with an operation on par with case-mapping:\r\n at parse time, the old property is converted into the new property.\r\n This conversion also applies in the CSSOM,\r\n both for string arguments and property accessors:\r\n requests for the old property name\r\n transparently transfer to the new property name instead. \r\n [](#example-5dd1d5a6) For example, if old-name is a [legacy name alias](#legacy-name-alias) for new-name, getComputedStyle(el).oldName will return the computed style of the newName property,\r\n and el.style.setPropertyValue(\"old-name\", \"value\") will set the new-name property to \"value\". \r\n **legacy shorthands** \r\n \r\n When the old property has a distinct syntax from the new property,\r\n the two names are aliased using the [shorthand](#shorthand-property) mechanism.\r\n These shorthands are defined to be [legacy shorthands](#legacy-shorthand),\r\n and their use is deprecated.\r\n They otherwise behave exactly as regular shorthands,\r\n except that the CSSOM will not use them\r\n when serializing declarations. [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) \r\n \r\n [](#example-c7a1887e) For example, the page-break-* properties\r\n are [legacy shorthands](#legacy-shorthand) for the break-* properties\r\n (see [CSS Fragmentation 3 § 3.4 Page Break Aliases: the page-break-before, page-break-after, and page-break-inside properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#page-break-properties)). \r\n \nSetting [page-break-before: always](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#propdef-page-break-before) expands to [break-before: page](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before) at parse time,\r\n like other shorthands do.\r\n Similarly, if break-before: page is set,\r\n calling getComputedStyle(el).pageBreakBefore will return \"always\".\r\n However, when serializing a style block\r\n (see [CSSOM 1 § 6.7.2 Serializing CSS Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values)),\r\n the page-break-before property will never be chosen as the shorthand to serialize to,\r\n regardless of whether it or break-before was specified;\r\n instead, break-before will always be chosen.\n\r\n \r\n \r\n 3.2.

[[css-writing-modes-3]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-3)\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-dae18981) For example, if an author specifies [all: initial](#propdef-all) on an element,\r\n it will block all inheritance and reset all properties,\r\n as if no rules appeared in the author, user, or user-agent levels of the cascade. \r\n \nThis can be useful for the root element of a \"widget\" included in a page,\r\n which does not wish to inherit the styles of the outer page.\r\n Note, however, that any \"default\" style applied to that element\r\n (such as, e.g. [display: block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display) from the UA style sheet on block elements such as `<div>`)\r\n will also be blown away.",

Cascaded Values[](#cascaded)\r\n \nThe **cascaded value** represents the result of [the cascade](#cascade):\r\n it is the [declared value](#declared-value) that wins the cascade\r\n (is sorted first in the [output of the cascade](#output-of-the-cascade)).\r\n If the output of the cascade is an empty list,\r\n there is no [cascaded value](#cascaded-value).\n\r\n 4.3. Specified Values[](#specified)\r\n \nThe **specified value** is\r\n the value of a given property that the style sheet authors intended for that element.\r\n It is the result of putting the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) through the [defaulting](#defaulting) processes,\r\n guaranteeing that a [specified value](#specified-value) exists for every property on every element.\n\r\n \nIn many cases, the [specified value](#specified-value) is the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value).\r\n However, if there is no cascaded value at all,\r\n the specified value is [defaulted](#defaulting).\r\n The [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) are handled specially\r\n when they are the cascaded value of a property,\r\n setting the specified value as required by that keyword,\r\n see [§ 7.3 Explicit Defaulting](#defaulting-keywords).\n\r\n 4.4. Computed Values[](#computed)\r\n \nThe **computed value** is\r\n the result of resolving the [specified value](#specified-value) as defined in the “Computed Value” line of the property definition table,\r\n generally absolutizing it in preparation for [inheritance](#inheritance).\n\r\n \nNote: The [computed value](#computed-value) is the value that is transferred from parent to child during [inheritance](#inheritance).\r\n For historical reasons,\r\n it is not necessarily the value returned by the [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle) function,\r\n which sometimes returns [used values](#used-value). [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) Furthermore, the computed value is an abstract data representation:\r\n their definitions reflect that data representation,\r\n not how that data is serialized.\r\n For example, serialization rules often allow omitting certain values which are implied during parsing;\r\n but those values are nonetheless part of the computed value.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-29410c97) A [specified value](#specified-value) can be either absolute (i.e., not relative to another value, as in [red](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-red) or 2mm)\r\n or relative (i.e., relative to another value, as in [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto), 2em).\r\n Computing a relative value generally absolutizes it: \r\n \n\r\n values with relative units\r\n ([em](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#em), [ex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#ex), [vh](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#valdef-length-vh), [vw](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#valdef-length-vw))\r\n must be made absolute by multiplying with the appropriate reference size \r\n certain keywords\r\n (e.g., smaller, [bolder](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-weight-bolder))\r\n must be replaced according to their definitions \r\n percentages on some properties must be multiplied by a reference value\r\n (defined by the property) \r\n valid relative URLs must be resolved to become absolute. \r\n \n\r\n \nSee examples (f), (g) and (h) in the [table below](#stages-examples).\n\r\n \r\n \nNote: In general, the [computed value](#computed-value) resolves the [specified value](#specified-value) as far as possible without laying out the document\r\n or performing other expensive or hard-to-parallelize operations,\r\n such as resolving network requests\r\n or retrieving values other than from the element and its parent.\n\r\n \nThe [computed value](#computed-value) exists even when the property does not apply.\r\n However, some properties may change how they determine the computed value based on whether the property [applies to](#apply) the element.\n\r\n 4.5. Used Values[](#used)\r\n \nThe **used value** is\r\n the result of taking the [computed value](#computed-value) and completing any remaining calculations to make it the absolute theoretical value\r\n used in the formatting of the document.\n\r\n \n[](#example-aaa6b50b) For example, a declaration of [width: auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) can’t be resolved into a length without knowing the layout of the element’s ancestors,\r\n so the [computed value](#computed-value) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto),\r\n while the [used value](#used-value) is an absolute length, such as 100px. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) \n\r\n \n[](#example-aac2d669) As another example, a `<div>` might have a computed [break-before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before) value of [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto),\r\n but acquire a used break-before value of [page](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#valdef-break-before-page) by propagation from its first child. [[css-break-3]](#biblio-css-break-3) \n\r\n \nIf a property does not [apply to](#apply) this element or box type\r\n then it has no [used value](#used-value) for that property.\n\r\n \n[](#example-19a1092f) For example, the [flex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#propdef-flex) property has no [used value](#used-value) on elements that aren’t [flex items](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-item). \n\r\n 4.5.1. Applicable Properties[](#applies-to)\r\n \nIf a property does not **apply to** an element or box type—as noted in its “Applies to” line—this means it does not directly take effect on that type of box or element.\n\r\n \nNote: A property that does not apply\r\n can still have indirect formatting effects\r\n if its computed value affects the computation of other properties\r\n that do apply;\r\n and of course its [computed value](#computed-value),\r\n which always exists,\r\n can still inherit to descendants\r\n and take effect on them.\n\r\n [](#example-9b82d3cf) Even though [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode) and [text-orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-text-orientation) do not apply to table rows\r\n (they do not affect how the table row or its children are laid out),\r\n setting them on such boxes\r\n will still affect the calculation of font relative units such as [ch](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#ch),\r\n and thus possibly any property that takes a [<length>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#length-value). \r\n [](#example-c1c9d619) Setting [text-transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-transform) on an HTML `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` element\r\n (which is [display: block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display) by default)\r\n will have an effect,\r\n even though text-transform only applies to [inline boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box),\r\n because the property inherits\r\n into the paragraph’s anonymous [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box) and applies to the text it contains. \r\n \nNote: A property defined to apply to “all elements”\r\n applies to all elements and [display types](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#display-type),\r\n but not necessarily to all [pseudo-element](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element) types,\r\n since pseudo-elements often have their own specific rendering models\r\n or other restrictions.\r\n The [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) and [::after](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-after) pseudo-elements, however,\r\n are defined to generate boxes almost exactly like normal elements\r\n and are therefore defined accept all properties that apply to “all elements”.\r\n See [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4) for more information about pseudo-elements.\n\r\n 4.6. Actual Values[](#actual)\r\n \nA [used value](#used-value) is in principle ready to be used,\r\n but a user agent may not be able to make use of the value in a given environment. For example, a user agent may only be able to render borders with integer pixel widths\r\n and may therefore have to approximate the [used](#used-value) width.\r\n Also, the font size of an element may need adjustment based on the availability of fonts\r\n or the value of the [font-size-adjust](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#propdef-font-size-adjust) property. The **actual value** is\r\n the used value after any such adjustments have been made.\n\r\n \nNote: By probing the actual values of elements,\r\n much can be learned about how the document is laid out.\r\n However, not all information is recorded in the actual values.\r\n For example, the actual value of the [page-break-after](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#propdef-page-break-after) property\r\n does not reflect whether there is a page break or not after the element.\r\n Similarly, the actual value of [orphans](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-orphans) does not reflect how many orphan lines there is in a certain element.\r\n See examples (j) and (k) in the [table below](#stages-examples).\n\r\n 4.7.

Per-Fragment Value Processing[](#fragments)\r\n \nCertain CSS features\r\n can interfere with value processing\r\n on a per-fragment basis.\r\n See for example [CSS Pseudo-Elements 4 § 2.1.3 Inheritance and the ::first-line Pseudo-element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#first-line-inheritance) which alters inheritance for fragments within the [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) pseudo-element.\r\n In such cases, where individual fragments are given different [specified values](#specified-value),\r\n any values that resolve\r\n based on the [computed value](#computed-value) of other properties\r\n (such as [currentcolor](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-currentcolor) or [em](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#em) units)\r\n are resolved per [box fragment](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment).\r\n Subsequent value processing proceeds as normal in each fragment.\n\r\n \nAPIs that assume a singular value per [box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#box) (rather than per [box fragment](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment))\r\n must ignore the effects of non-[tree-abiding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#tree-abiding) [pseudo-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element).\r\n (For example, [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) styles have no effect on the value returned by [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle).)\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-d0a2e292) For example, given the following markup: \r\n\n```\n<div><span>First line<br />Second line</span></div>\r\n<div><span>First line</span></div>\r\n<div>First line<br><span>Second line</span></div>\r\n<style>\r\ndiv { color: blue; }\r\ndiv::first-line { color: yellow; }\r\nspan { border: thin solid currentcolor; }\r\n</style>\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nIn each `[div](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element)`, the “First line” text is yellow and the “Second line” text is blue;\r\n the border for each fragment of the `[span](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element)`s that wrap each line matches that color.\n\r\n \nHowever, [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle) on all three of the spans\r\n will return `\"blue\"` for [border-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-color),\r\n because the effects of a [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) pseudo-element\r\n are ignored for APIs that aren’t fragment-aware.",

Cascade Sorting Order[](#cascade-sort)\r\n \nThe cascade sorts declarations according to the following criteria,\r\n in descending order of priority:\n\r\n \r\n [](#cascade-origin)Origin and Importance \r\n \r\n The [origin](#origin) of a declaration is based on where it comes from\r\n and its [importance](#important) is\r\n whether or not it is declared with !important (see [below](#importance)).\r\n The precedence of the various origins is, in descending order: \r\n \n\r\n Transition declarations [[css-transitions-1]](#biblio-css-transitions-1) \r\n [Important](#important) [user agent](#cascade-origin-ua) declarations \r\n [Important](#important) [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations \r\n [Important](#important) [author](#cascade-origin-author) declarations \r\n Animation declarations [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1) \r\n [Normal](#normal) [author](#cascade-origin-author) declarations \r\n [Normal](#normal) [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations \r\n [Normal](#normal) [user agent](#cascade-origin-ua) declarations \r\n \n\r\n \nDeclarations from [origins](#origin) earlier in this list win over declarations from later origins.\n\r\n [](#cascade-context)Context \r\n \r\n A document language can provide for blending declarations sourced\r\n from different **encapsulation contexts**,\r\n such as the nested [tree contexts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#tree-context) of [shadow trees](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-tree) in the [[DOM]](#biblio-dom). \r\n \nWhen comparing two declarations\r\n that are sourced from different [encapsulation contexts](#encapsulation-contexts),\r\n then for [normal](#normal) rules\r\n the declaration from the outer context wins,\r\n and for [important](#important) rules\r\n the declaration from the inner context wins.\r\n For this purpose, [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) [tree contexts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#tree-context) are considered to be nested\r\n in [shadow-including tree order](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-tree-order).\n\r\n \nNote: This effectively means that [normal](#normal) declarations belonging to an [encapsulation context](#encapsulation-contexts) can set defaults that are easily overridden by the outer context,\r\n while [important](#important) declarations belonging to an encapsulation context can enforce requirements that cannot be overridden by the outer context.\n\r\n [](#style-attr)Element-Attached Styles \r\n \r\n Separately for [normal](#normal) and [important](#important) declarations,\r\n declarations that are attached directly to an element\r\n (such as the [contents of a style attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-style-attr/#interpret))\r\n rather than indirectly mapped by means of a style rule selector\r\n take precedence over declarations the same importance that are mapped via style rule. \r\n \nSee [[css-style-attr]](#biblio-css-style-attr).\n\r\n \nNote: Non-CSS presentational hints (such as presentational markup)\r\n are handled separately,\r\n see [§ 6.5 Precedence of Non-CSS Presentational Hints](#preshint).\n\r\n [](#cascade-layering)Layers \r\n \r\n Declarations within each [origin](#origin) and [context](#encapsulation-contexts) can be explicitly assigned to a [cascade layer](#cascade-layers).\r\n For the purpose of this step,\r\n any declaration not assigned to an explicit layer\r\n is added to an implicit final layer. \r\n \nCascade layers (like declarations) are ordered by order of appearance.\r\n When comparing declarations that belong to different layers,\r\n then for [normal](#normal) rules the declaration whose [cascade layer](#cascade-layers) is last wins,\r\n and for [important](#important) rules the declaration whose cascade layer is first wins.\n\r\n \nNote: This follows the same logic used for layering [normal](#normal) and [important](#important) [origins](#origin),\r\n so that the !important flag maintains the same “override” purpose in both settings.\n\r\n [](#cascade-specificity)Specificity \r\n The [Selectors module](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity) [[SELECT]](#biblio-select) describes how to compute the specificity of a selector.\r\n Each declaration has the same specificity as the style rule it appears in.\r\n The declaration with the highest specificity wins. \r\n [](#cascade-order)Order of Appearance \r\n \r\n The last declaration in document order wins.\r\n For this purpose: \r\n \n\r\n Style sheets are ordered as in [final CSS style sheets](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#documentorshadowroot-final-css-style-sheets). \r\n Declarations from [imported style sheets](#at-ruledef-import) are ordered as if their style sheets were substituted in place of the @import rule. \r\n Declarations from style sheets independently linked by the originating document\r\n are treated as if they were concatenated in linking order,\r\n as determined by the host document language. \r\n Declarations from style attributes\r\n are ordered according to the document order of the element the style attribute appears on,\r\n and are all placed after any style sheets. \r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nThe **output of the cascade** is a (potentially empty) sorted list of [declared values](#declared-value) for each property on each element.\n\r\n 6.2. Cascading Origins[](#cascading-origins)\r\n \nEach style rule has a **cascade origin**,\r\n which determines where it enters the cascade.\r\n CSS defines three core [origins](#origin):\n\r\n \r\n **Author Origin** \r\n The author specifies style sheets for a source document\r\n according to the conventions of the document language.\r\n For instance, in HTML,\r\n style sheets may be included in the document or linked externally. \r\n **User Origin** \r\n The user may be able to specify style information for a particular document.\r\n For example, the user may specify a file that contains a style sheet\r\n or the user agent may provide an interface that generates a user style sheet\r\n (or behaves as if it did). \r\n **User-Agent Origin** \r\n Conforming user agents must apply a default style sheet\r\n (or behave as if they did).\r\n A user agent’s default style sheet should present the elements of the document language\r\n in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations for the document language\r\n (e.g., for visual browsers, the EM element in HTML is presented using an italic font).\r\n See e.g. the [HTML user agent style sheet](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints). [[HTML]](#biblio-html) \r\n \r\n \nExtensions to CSS define the following additional [origins](#origin):\n\r\n \r\n **Animation Origin** \r\n CSS Animations [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1) generate “virtual” rules representing their effects when running. \r\n **Transition Origin[](#cascade-origin-transition)** \r\n Like CSS Animations, CSS Transitions [[css-transitions-1]](#biblio-css-transitions-1) generate “virtual” rules representing their effects when running. \r\n \r\n 6.3. Important Declarations: the !important annotation[](#importance)\r\n \nCSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets.\r\n By default, rules in an author’s style sheet override those in a user’s style sheet,\r\n which override those in the user-agent’s default style sheet.\r\n To balance this, a declaration can be marked [important](#important),\r\n which increases its weight in the cascade and inverts the order of precedence.\n\r\n \nA declaration is **important** if it has a !important annotation as defined by [[css-syntax-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3),\r\n i.e. if the last two (non-whitespace, non-comment) tokens\r\n in its value are the delimiter token ! followed by the identifier token important.\r\n All other declarations are **normal** (non-[important](#important)).\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-813b5c64) \r\n\n```\n[hidden] { display: none !important; }\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nAn [important](#important) declaration takes precedence over a [normal](#normal) declaration.\r\n Author and user style sheets may contain important declarations,\r\n with [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) important declarations\r\n overriding [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) important declarations.\r\n This CSS feature improves accessibility of documents\r\n by giving users with special requirements\r\n (large fonts, color combinations, etc.)\r\n control over presentation.\n\r\n \n[Important](#important) declarations from all origins take precedence over animations.\r\n This allows authors to override animated values in important cases.\r\n (Animated values normally override all other rules.) [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1)\n\r\n \n[User-agent style sheets](#cascade-origin-ua) may also contain [important](#important) declarations.\r\n These override all [author](#cascade-origin-author) and [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-b189d121) The first rule in the user’s style sheet in the following example contains an !important declaration,\r\n which overrides the corresponding declaration in the author’s style sheet.\r\n The declaration in the second rule will also win due to being marked !important.\r\n However, the third declaration in the user’s style sheet is not !important and will therefore lose to the second rule in the author’s style sheet\r\n (which happens to set style on a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property).\r\n Also, the third author rule will lose to the second author rule since the second declaration is !important.\r\n This shows that !important declarations have a function also within author style sheets. \r\n\n```\n/* From the user’s style sheet */\r\np { text-indent: 1em !important }\r\np { font-style: italic !important }\r\np { font-size: 18pt }\r\n\r\n/* From the author’s style sheet */\r\np { text-indent: 1.5em !important }\r\np { font: normal 12pt sans-serif !important }\r\np { font-size: 24pt }\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Property \r\n Winning value \r\n \r\n \r\n [text-indent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-indent) \r\n 1em \r\n \r\n [font-style](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-style) \r\n [italic](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-style-italic) \r\n \r\n [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size) \r\n 12pt \r\n \r\n [font-family](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-family) \r\n [sans-serif](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-family-sans-serif) \r\n \r\n \r\n 6.4. Cascade Layers[](#layering)\r\n \nIn the same way that [cascade origins](#origin) provide a balance of power\r\n between user and author styles, **cascade layers** provide a structured way\r\n to organize and balance concerns within a single origin.\r\n Rules within a single [cascade layer](#cascade-layers) cascade together,\r\n without interleaving with style rules outside the layer.\n\r\n \nAuthors can create layers to represent element defaults,\r\n third-party libraries, themes, components,\r\n overrides, and other styling concerns—and are able to re-order the cascade of layers in an explicit way,\r\n without altering selectors or specificity within each layer,\r\n or relying on source-order to resolve conflicts across layers.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-d1251f4f) For example, the following generates an explicit reset layer,\r\n with lower cascade weight than any unlayered styles: \r\n\n```\naudio {\r\n /* specificity of 0,0,1 - implicit (final) layer */\r\n display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer reset {\r\n audio[controls] {\r\n /* specificity of 0,1,1 - explicit \"reset\" layer */\r\n display: block;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nThe unlayered declarations on the `[audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#audio)` element take precedence\r\n over the explicitly layered declarations on `audio[controls]` —even though the unlayered styles have a lower specificity,\r\n and come first in the source order.\n\r\n \r\n \nName-defining [at-rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#at-rule) such as [@keyframes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#at-ruledef-keyframes) or [@font-face](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#at-font-face-rule) that are defined inside [cascade layers](#cascade-layers) also use the layer order when resolving name collisions.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-3ebc99c8) For example,\r\n authors could override the animation from a framework,\r\n by providing keyframes with the same name in a higher-priority layer: \r\n\n```\n/* establish the layer order, so the \"override\" layer takes precedence */\r\n@layer framework, override;\r\n\r\n@layer override {\r\n @keyframes slide-left {\r\n from { translate: 0; }\r\n to { translate: -100% 0; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer framework {\r\n @keyframes slide-left {\r\n from { margin-left: 0; }\r\n to { margin-left: -100%; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.sidebar { animation: slide-left 300ms; }\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nIn this case the override layer\r\n has a higher cascade priority than the framework layer,\r\n so `slide-left` will animate\r\n using the `translate` property rather than `margin-left`.\n\r\n \r\n 6.4.1. Declaring Cascade Layers[](#layer-declaration)\r\n \nCascade layers can be declared:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nusing an [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rule with the layer keyword or layer() function,\r\nassigning the contents of the imported file into that layer.\n\r\n \r\n \nusing a [@layer block at-rule](#layer-block),\r\nassigning its child style rules into that layer.\n\r\n \r\n \nusing a [@layer statement at-rule](#layer-empty),\r\ndeclaring a named layer without assigning any rules.\n\r\n \n\r\n \n[](#issue-3d8c81e9) Provide an attribute for assigning link or style elements to cascade layers? [[Issue #w3c/csswg-drafts#5853]](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5853)\n\r\n 6.4.2. Layer Naming and Nesting[](#layer-names)\r\n \nA [cascade layer](#cascade-layers) has a **layer name**,\r\n which is an ordered list representing each level of layer nesting,\r\n each segment of which can be named (as a CSS identifier)\r\n or anonymous.\r\n (Thus, when a layer is nested inside of another layer,\r\n this concatenates their names.)\r\n One layer is nested in another\r\n when it is declared within the scope of another layer,\r\n e.g. an [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rule inside another @layer,\r\n a layered [@import](#at-ruledef-import) inside a layered import,\r\n or an @layer rule inside a layered import.\n\r\n \n[Layer names](#layer-name) represent the same [cascade layer](#cascade-layers) if they contain the same segments in the same order;\r\n however anonymous segments have unique identities for each occurrence.\r\n Note that nesting can cause multiple layers to share the same anonymous segment.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-8b497e80) Explicit layer identifiers provide a way\r\n to assign multiple style blocks to a single layer.\r\n In the following example,\r\n the contents of `headings.css` and `links.css` are cascaded within the same layer as the `audio[controls]` rule: \r\n\n```\n@import url(headings.css) layer(default);\r\n@import url(links.css) layer(default);\r\n\r\n@layer default {\r\n audio[controls] {\r\n display: block;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \r\n [](#example-23b0f30e) In this example,\r\n the nested framework.base layer is distinct\r\n from the top-level base layer: \r\n\n```\n@layer base {\r\n p { max-width: 70ch; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer framework {\r\n @layer base {\r\n p { margin-block: 0.75em; }\r\n }\r\n\r\n @layer theme {\r\n p { color: #222; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nThe resulting layers can be represented as a tree:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nbase\n\r\n \r\n \nframework\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nbase\n\r\n \r\n \ntheme\n\r\n \n\r\n \n\r\n \nor as a flat list with nested identifiers:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nbase\n\r\n \r\n \nframework.base\n\r\n \r\n \nframework.theme\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nSyntactically, an explicit [layer name](#layer-name) is represented\r\n by the [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name) in [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) and [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules,\r\n which is a period-separated list of [<ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-ident) tokens\r\n with no intervening white space:\n\r\n\n```\n**[<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name)** = [<ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-ident) [ '.' [<ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-ident) ][*](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-zero-plus)\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nThe [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) are reserved for future use,\r\n and cause the rule to be invalid at parse time\r\n if used as an [<ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-ident) in the [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name).\r\n When multiple identifiers are concatenated with a period,\r\n this is a shorthand representing those layers nested in order.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-cd070ab3) \r\n\n```\n@layer framework {\r\n @layer default {\r\n p { margin-block: 0.75em; }\r\n }\r\n\r\n @layer theme {\r\n p { color: #222; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer framework.theme {\r\n /* These styles will be added to the theme layer inside the framework layer */\r\n blockquote { color: rebeccapurple; }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nNote: A nested layer cannot “escape” its parent layer\r\n to reference layers outside itself.\n\r\n 6.4.2.1. Anonymous Layers[](#unnamed-layers)\r\n \nWhen a [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rule omits its [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name),\r\n or an [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rule uses the layer keyword (which does not provide a <layer-name>),\r\n its [layer name](#layer-name) gains a unique anonymous segment;\r\n it therefore cannot be referenced from the outside.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-787042b6) Each occurrence of an anonymous layer declaration\r\n represents a unique cascade layer,\r\n thus: \r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nMultiple unnamed layer rules\r\nplace their styles into separate layers,\r\nas each occurrence is referencing a distinct anonymous layer name.\n\r\n\n```\n@layer { /* layer 1 */ }\r\n@layer { /* layer 2 */ }\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nWithin a single unnamed layer,\r\nchild layers with the same name refer to the same cascade layer,\r\nbecause they share the same anonymous parent layer.\n\r\n\n```\n@layer {\r\n @layer foo { /* layer 1 */ }\r\n @layer foo { /* also layer 1 */ }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nWhereas in separate unnamed layers,\r\nchild layers with the same name refer to different cascade layers,\r\nbecause they have distinct anonymous parent layers.\n\r\n\n```\n@layer {\r\n @layer foo { /* layer 1 */ }\r\n}\r\n@layer {\r\n @layer foo { /* layer 2 */ }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \r\n [](#example-52455707) A layer declared without a [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name) does not provide any external hook for re-arranging or adding styles. \r\n \nWhile this can be a mere convenience for brevity,\r\n it can also be used by teams as a way to force an organizing convention\r\n (all code in that layer must be defined in the same place),\r\n or by libraries wanting to merge & hide a set of internal “private” layers\r\n that they don’t want exposed to author manipulation:\n\r\n\n```\n/* bootstrap-base.css */\r\n/* unnamed wrapper layers around each sub-file */\r\n@import url(base-forms.css) layer;\r\n@import url(base-links.css) layer;\r\n@import url(base-headings.css) layer;\r\n\n```\n\r\n\n```\n/* bootstrap.css */\r\n/* the internal names are hidden from access, subsumed in \"base\" */\r\n@import url(bootstrap-base.css) layer(base);\r\n\n```\n\r\n\n```\n/* author.css */\r\n/* author has access to bootstrap.base layer, but not into unnamed layers */\r\n@import url(bootstrap.css) layer(bootstrap);\r\n\r\n/* Adds additional styles to the bootstrap layer: */\r\n@layer bootstrap {...}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n 6.4.3. Layer Ordering[](#layer-ordering)\r\n \nCascade layers are sorted\r\n by the order in which they first are declared,\r\n with nested layers grouped within their parent layers\r\n before any unlayered rules.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-ffb1a154) Given the following layer rules: \r\n\n```\n/* unlayered styles come last in the layer order */\r\nh1 { color: darkslateblue; }\r\n\r\n@layer reset.type {\r\n strong { font-weight: bold; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer framework {\r\n .title { font-weight: 100; }\r\n\r\n @layer theme {\r\n h1, h2 { color: maroon; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer reset {\r\n [hidden] { display: none; }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nThe outer layers are sorted first,\r\n with any unlayered style rules\r\n added to an implicit outer layer which\r\n has higher priority than (comes after) the explicit layers:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nreset\n\r\n \r\n \nframework\n\r\n \r\n \n(implicit outer layer)\n\r\n \n\r\n \nWithin each layer,\r\n nested layers are sorted in appearance order,\r\n and style rules without further nesting\r\n are similarly added to an implicit sub-layer\r\n after the explicitly nested layers:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nreset.type\n\r\n \r\n \nreset (implicit sub-layer)\n\r\n \r\n \nframework.theme\n\r\n \r\n \nframework (implicit sub-layer)\n\r\n \r\n \n(implicit outer layer)\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nLayers that are defined inside of a [conditional group rule](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#conditional-group-rule) do not contribute to the layer order unless the condition is true\r\n or unless the conditional group rule can evaluate differently\r\n for different elements in the document.\n\r\n \nNote: Since the layer order is global to the document,\r\n any layers defined inside an element-sensitive [conditional group rule](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#conditional-group-rule) need to be accommodated when establishing the global layer order,\r\n regardless of the rule’s condition.\r\n Conditions that are global to the document, however\r\n (such as [@media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-media) and [@supports](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-supports))\r\n can accommodate such [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rules conditionally.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-87e2d331) For example,\r\n the following layer order\r\n will depend on which media conditions match: \r\n\n```\n@media (min-width: 30em) {\r\n @layer layout {\r\n .title { font-size: x-large; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n @layer theme {\r\n .title { color: white; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer theme, layout;\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nIf the first media-query matches based on viewport dimensions,\r\n then the [layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-1/#valdef-contain-layout) layer will come first in the layer order.\r\n If the color-scheme preference query matches,\r\n or if neither condition is true,\r\n then theme will come first in the layer order.\n\r\n \nAuthors who want to avoid this behavior can establish\r\n an explicit ordering of layers in advance,\r\n and avoid defining new layers inside conditional rules.\n\r\n \r\n \nNote: [Cascade layers](#cascade-layers) are scoped to their [origin](#origin) and [context](#encapsulation-contexts),\r\n so the ordering of layers in the light DOM has no impact\r\n on the order of identically-named layers in the shadow DOM\r\n (and vice versa).\n\r\n \n[](#issue-e29f5f96) Allow authors to explicitly place unlayered styles in the layer order [[Issue #6323]](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6323)\n\r\n 6.4.4.

Assigning Styles Inline: the [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) block at-rule[](#layer-block)\r\n \nThe [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) [block at-rule](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#block-at-rule) assigns its child style rules to a particular named [cascade layer](#cascade-layers).\r\n This block layer-assignment syntax is:\n\r\n\n```\n@layer [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name)[?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt) {\r\n [<stylesheet>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-stylesheet)\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nSuch [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) block rules have the same restrictions and processing\r\n as a [conditional group rule](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#conditional-group-rule) [[CSS-CONDITIONAL-3]](#biblio-css-conditional-3) with a true condition.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-149ef997) For example, [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) and [@media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-media) can be mixed: \r\n\n```\n@layer framework {\r\n h1, h2 { color: maroon; background: white;}\r\n\r\n @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n h1, h2 { color: red; background: black; }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nNote: [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) [block at-rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#block-at-rule) cannot be interleaved with [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules.\n\r\n 6.4.4.2. Declaring Without Styles: the [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) statement at-rule[](#layer-empty)\r\n \nThe [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rule can also be used to define new layers\r\n without assigning any style rules, by providing only the [layer name](#layer-name):\n\r\n\n```\n@layer [<layer-name>](#typedef-layer-name)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma);\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nSuch empty [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rules are allowed before [@import](#at-ruledef-import) and @namespace rules\r\n (after the [@charset](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#at-ruledef-charset) rule, if any)\r\n as well as everywhere @layer [block at-rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#block-at-rule) are allowed.\n\r\n \nNote: No [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rules are allowed between [@import](#at-ruledef-import) and @namespace rules.\r\n Any @layer rule that comes after an @import or @namespace rule\r\n will cause any subsequent @import or @namespace rules to be ignored.\n\r\n \nUnlike the [block syntax](#layer-block),\r\n multiple comma-separated layer names can be provided in this syntax,\r\n declaring each of the layers in the order specified.\n\r\n \nNote: Since layer ordering is defined by first occurrence of the layer name\r\n (see [§ 6.4.3 Layer Ordering](#layer-ordering)),\r\n this rule allows a page to declare the order of its layers up front,\r\n so that their order is apparent without having to read the entire style sheet.\r\n It also allows inline layers to be interleaved with imported layers,\r\n which is not possible with the [block syntax](#layer-block).\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-aa4a55a5) The statement syntax\r\n allows establishing a layer order in advance,\r\n regardless of the order in which style rules are added to each layer.\r\n It can be helpful to establish that layer order in advance,\r\n before any [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules.\r\n In this example,\r\n the imported `theme.css` style rules will override\r\n any rules added in the later default block\r\n since the order of layers has already been established: \r\n\n```\n@layer default, theme, components;\r\n@import url(theme.css) layer(theme);\r\n\r\n@layer default {\r\n audio[controls] {\r\n display: block;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nIt’s also possible to have [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules\r\n help establish the order,\r\n by placing them between [@layer](#at-ruledef-layer) rules.\r\n This example will have the same result:\n\r\n\n```\n@layer default;\r\n@import url(theme.css) layer(theme);\r\n@layer components;\r\n\r\n@layer default {\r\n audio[controls] {\r\n display: block;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \nHowever, [@import](#at-ruledef-import) and @namespace rules must be consecutive,\r\n without any intervening rules.\r\n The following is invalid:\n\r\n\n```\n@import url(default.css) layer(default);\r\n@layer theme;\r\n@import url(components.css) layer(components);\r\n\r\n@layer theme {\r\n audio[controls] {\r\n display: block;\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n 6.5. Precedence of Non-CSS Presentational Hints[](#preshint)\r\n \nThe UA may choose to honor presentational hints in a source document’s markup,\r\n for example the `bgcolor` attribute or `[s](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element)` element in [[HTML]](#biblio-html).\r\n All document language-based styling must be translated to corresponding CSS rules\r\n and enter the cascade as rules in either\r\n the [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) or a special-purpose **author presentational hint origin** between the regular [user origin](#cascade-origin-user) and the [author origin](#cascade-origin-author).\r\n For the purpose of [cascading](#cascade) this [author presentational hint origin](#author-presentational-hint-origin) is treated as an independent [origin](#origin),\r\n but for the purpose of the [revert](#valdef-all-revert) keyword\r\n it is considered part of the author origin.\n\r\n \nA document language may define whether such a presentational hint\r\n enters the [cascade](#cascade) as [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) or [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author);\r\n if so, the UA must behave accordingly.\r\n For example, [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11) maps its presentation attributes into the author origin.\n\r\n \nNote: Presentational hints entering the [cascade](#cascade) as [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) rules\r\n can be overridden by [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) or [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) styles.\r\n Presentational hints entering the cascade as [author presentational hint origin](#author-presentational-hint-origin) rules\r\n can be overridden by author-origin styles,\r\n but not by non-[important](#important) user-origin styles.\r\n Host languages should choose the appropriate origin for presentational hints\r\n with these considerations in mind.",

[Pseudo-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element) inherit according to the fictional tag sequence\r\n described for each pseudo-element. [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4)\n\r\n \nSome properties are **inherited properties**,\r\n as defined in their property definition table.\r\n This means that,\r\n unless the [cascade](#cascade) results in a value,\r\n the value will be determined by [inheritance](#inheritance).\n\r\n \nA property can also be explicitly inherited. See the [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit) keyword.\n\r\n \nNote: Inheritance follows the document tree and is not intercepted by [anonymous boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#box-gen),\r\n or otherwise affected by manipulations of the box tree.\n\r\n 7.3. Explicit Defaulting[](#defaulting-keywords)\r\n \nSeveral CSS-wide property values are defined below;\r\n declaring a property to have these values explicitly specifies a particular defaulting behavior.\r\n As specified in [CSS Values and Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#common-keywords) [[css-values-3]](#biblio-css-values-3),\r\n all CSS properties can accept these values.\n\r\n 7.3.1. Resetting a Property: the [initial](#valdef-all-initial) keyword[](#initial)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **initial** keyword,\r\n the property’s [specified value](#specified-value) is its [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n 7.3.2. Explicit Inheritance: the [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit) keyword[](#inherit)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **inherit** keyword,\r\n the property’s [specified](#specified-value) and [computed values](#computed-value) are the [inherited value](#inherited-value).\n\r\n 7.3.3. Erasing All Declarations: the [unset](#valdef-all-unset) keyword[](#inherit-initial)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **unset** keyword,\r\n then if it is an inherited property, this is treated as [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit),\r\n and if it is not, this is treated as [initial](#valdef-all-initial).\r\n This keyword effectively erases all [declared values](#declared-value) occurring earlier in the [cascade](#cascade),\r\n correctly inheriting or not as appropriate for the property\r\n (or all longhands of a [shorthand](#shorthand-property)).\n\r\n 7.3.4. Rolling Back Cascade Origins: the [revert](#valdef-all-revert) keyword[](#default)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **revert** keyword,\r\n the behavior depends on the [cascade origin](#origin) to which the declaration belongs:\n\r\n \r\n [user-agent origin](#cascade-origin-ua) \r\n Equivalent to [unset](#valdef-all-unset). \r\n [user origin](#cascade-origin-user) \r\n Rolls back the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) to the user-agent level,\r\n so that the [specified value](#specified-value) is calculated\r\n as if no [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) or [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) rules were specified\r\n for this property on this element. \r\n [author origin](#cascade-origin-author) \r\n Rolls back the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) to the user level,\r\n so that the [specified value](#specified-value) is calculated\r\n as if no [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) rules were specified\r\n for this property on this element.\r\n For the purpose of [revert](#valdef-all-revert), this origin includes the Animation [origin](#origin). \r\n \r\n 7.3.5. Rolling Back Cascade Layers: the [revert-layer](#valdef-all-revert-layer) keyword[](#revert-layer)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **revert-layer** keyword,\r\n the cascaded value is rolled back to the [layer](#cascade-layers) below,\r\n so that the [specified value](#specified-value) is calculated\r\n as if no rules were specified in the current cascade layer—or between its [normal](#normal) and [important](#important) levels in the [cascade](#cascade)—for this property on this element.\r\n For [revert-layer](#valdef-all-revert-layer) in important [element-attached styles](#style-attr),\r\n however,\r\n it only reverts the [element-attached styles](#style-attr) and the intervening [animation origin](#cascade-origin-animation),\r\n and not any of the intervening [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) important rules.\n\r\n \nNote: If there are no lower-priority declarations\r\n in the same [cascade origin](#origin) as the [revert-layer](#valdef-all-revert-layer) value,\r\n the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) will roll back to the previous origin.\n\r\n \nNote: The [animation origin](#cascade-origin-animation) is not collapsed with the [author origin](#cascade-origin-author) for this purpose\r\n as it is for [revert](#valdef-all-revert),\r\n and thus effectively forms its own [cascade layer](#cascade-layers).",
