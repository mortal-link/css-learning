      "content": "This section is normative. \n\n \nCSS takes a source document organized as\n a tree of elements (which can contain a mix of other [elements](#elements) and [text nodes](#text-nodes))\n and text nodes (which can contain text),\n and renders it onto a [canvas](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/intro.html#canvas) such as your screen, a piece of paper, or an audio stream.\n Although any such source document can be rendered with CSS,\n the most commonly used type is the DOM. [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) (Some of these more complex tree types might have additional types of nodes,\n such as the comment nodes in the DOM.\n For the purposes of CSS,\n all of these additional types of nodes are ignored,\n as if they didn’t exist.)\n\n \nTo do this, it generates an intermediary structure,\n the box tree,\n which represents the formatting structure of the rendered document.\n Each box in the [box tree](#box-tree) represents its corresponding [element](#elements) (or [pseudo-element](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element))\n in space and/or time on the canvas,\n while each **text sequence** in the box tree likewise represents the corresponding contents of its [text nodes](#text-nodes).\n\n \nTo create the [box tree](#box-tree),\n CSS first uses [cascading and inheritance](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/),\n to assign a [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) for each CSS property\n to each [element](#elements) and [text node](#text-nodes) in the source tree.\n (See [[CSS-CASCADE-3]](#biblio-css-cascade-3).)\n\n \nThen, for each [element](#elements),\n CSS generates zero or more [boxes](#box) as specified by that element’s [display](#propdef-display) property.\n Typically, an element generates a single box,\n the [principal box](#principal-box),\n which represents itself and contains its contents in the [box tree](#box-tree).\n However, some display values\n (e.g. display: list-item)\n generate more than one box\n (e.g. a [principal block box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#principal-box) and a child [marker box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#lists)).\n And some values\n (such as [none](#valdef-display-none) or [contents](#valdef-display-contents))\n cause the element and/or its descendants to not generate any boxes at all. Boxes are often referred to by their display type—​e.g. a box generated by an element with display: block is called a “block box” or just a “block”.\n\n \nA [box](#box) is assigned the same styles as its generating [element](#elements), unless otherwise indicated.\n In general, [inherited properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#inherited-property) are assigned to the [principal box](#principal-box),\n and then inherit through the box tree\n to any other boxes generated by the same element.\n Non-inherited properties default to applying to the principal box,\n but when the element generates multiple boxes,\n are sometimes defined to apply to a different box:\n for example, the [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border) properties applied to a table element\n are applied to its [table grid box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables-3/#table-grid-box),\n not to its principal [table wrapper box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables-3/#table-wrapper-box).\n If the value computation process alters the styles of those boxes,\n and the element’s style is requested\n (such as through [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle)),\n the element reflects,\n for each property,\n the value from the box to which that property was applied.\n\n \nSimilarly, each contiguous sequence of sibling [text nodes](#text-nodes) generates a [text sequence](#css-text-sequence) containing their text contents,\n which is assigned the same styles as the generating text nodes.\n If the sequence contains no text, however, it does not generate a text sequence.\n\n \nIn constructing the box tree,\n boxes generated by an element are descendants of\n the principal box of any ancestor elements.\n In the general case,\n the direct **parent box** of an element’s [principal box](#principal-box) is the principal box of its nearest ancestor element that generates a [box](#box);\n however, there are some exceptions,\n such as for [run-in](#valdef-display-run-in) boxes,\n display types (like tables) that generate multiple container boxes,\n and intervening [anonymous boxes](#anonymous).\n\n \nAn anonymous box is a box that is not associated with any element. [Anonymous boxes](#anonymous) are generated in certain circumstances\n to fix up the [box tree](#box-tree) when it requires a particular nested structure\n that is not provided by the boxes generated from the [element tree](#element-tree).\n For example, a [table cell box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display) requires a particular type of parent box (the [table row box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display)),\n and will generate an anonymous [table row box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display) around itself\n if its parent is not a [table row box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display).\n (See [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) § [17.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#anonymous-boxes).)\n Unlike element-generated boxes, whose styles inherit strictly through the element tree,\n anonymous boxes (which only exist in the box tree) [inherit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inheriting) through their box tree parentage.\n\n \nIn the course of layout, [boxes](#box) and [text sequences](#css-text-sequence) can be broken into multiple [fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#fragment).\n This happens, for example, when an [inline box](#inline-box) and/or text sequence is broken across lines,\n or when a [block box](#block-box) is broken across pages or columns,\n in a process called [fragmentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#fragmentation).\n It can also happen due to bidi reordering of text\n (see [Applying the Bidirectional Reordering Algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#bidi-algo) in [CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#text-direction))\n or higher-level [display type](#display-type) box splitting,\n e.g. [block-in-inline splitting](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#img-anon-block) (see [CSS2§9.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#box-gen))\n or [column-spanner-in-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1/#spanning-columns) splitting\n (see [CSS Multi-column Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1/#spanning-columns)).\n A box therefore consists of one or more [box fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#box-fragment),\n and a text sequence consists of one or more text fragments.\n See [[CSS-BREAK-3]](#biblio-css-break-3) for more information on fragmentation.\n\n \nNote: Many of the CSS specs were written before this terminology was ironed out,\n or refer to things incorrectly,\n so view older specs with caution when they’re using these terms.\n It should be possible to infer from context which term they really mean.\n Please [report errors](#sotd) in specs when you find them,\n so they can be corrected.\n\n \nNote: Further information on the “aural” box tree\n and its interaction with the [display](#propdef-display) property\n can be found in the [CSS Speech Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#aural-model).

on all media, including non-visual ones.\n The [display](#propdef-display) property defines an element’s **display type**,\n which consists of the two basic qualities of how an element generates boxes: \n\n \n\n \n \nthe **inner display type**,\nwhich defines (if it is a [non-replaced element](#replaced-element)) the kind of [formatting context](#formatting-context) it generates,\ndictating how its descendant boxes are laid out.\n(The inner display of a replaced element is outside the scope of CSS.)\n\n \n \nthe **outer display type**,\nwhich dictates how the [principal box](#principal-box) itself participates in [flow layout](#flow-layout).\n\n \n\n \n[Text sequences](#css-text-sequence) have no [display type](#display-type).\n\n \nSome [display](#propdef-display) values have additional side-effects:\n such as [list-item](#valdef-display-list-item), which also generates a [::marker](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-marker) pseudo-element,\n and [none](#valdef-display-none), which causes the element’s entire subtree to be left out of the box tree.\n\n The [display](#propdef-display) property has no effect on an element’s semantics:\n these are defined by the [document language](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#document-language) and are not affected by CSS.\n Aside from the [none](#valdef-display-none) value,\n which also affects the aural/speech output [[CSS-SPEECH-1]](#biblio-css-speech-1) and interactivity of an element and its descendants,\n the display property only affects visual layout:\n its purpose is to allow designers freedom\n to change the layout behavior of an element without affecting the underlying document semantics. \n \nValues are defined as follows:\n\n```\n**<display-outside>** = block

Layout-Internal Display Types: the table-* and ruby-* keywords[](#layout-specific-display)\n \nSome layout models, such as [table](#valdef-display-table) and [ruby](#valdef-display-ruby),\n have a complex internal structure,\n with several different roles that their children and descendants can fill.\n This section defines those “**layout-internal**” [display](#propdef-display) values,\n which only have meaning within that particular layout mode.\n\n \nUnless otherwise specified,\n both the [inner display type](#inner-display-type) and the [outer display type](#outer-display-type) of elements using these [display](#propdef-display) values\n are set to the given keyword.\n\n \nWhen the [display](#propdef-display) property of a [replaced element](#replaced-element) computes to\n one of the [layout-internal](#layout-internal) values,\n it is handled as having a used value of [inline](#valdef-display-inline).\n White space collapsing and anonymous box generation must happen around those replaced elements\n based on that inline value,\n as if they never had a layout-internal display value applied to them.\n\n \n Authors should not assign a [layout-internal](#layout-internal) display value to [replaced elements](#replaced-element).\n\n \nThe [<display-internal>](#typedef-display-internal) keywords are defined as follows:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-row-group\">table-row-group**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-header-group\">table-header-group**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-footer-group\">table-footer-group**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-row\">table-row**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-cell\">table-cell**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-column-group\">table-column-group**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-column\">table-column** \n \n The element is an **internal table element**.\n It generates the appropriate **internal table box** which participates in a table formatting context.\n See [CSS2§17.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display) [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2). \n \n[table-cell](#valdef-display-table-cell) boxes have a [flow-root](#valdef-display-flow-root) [inner display type](#inner-display-type).\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-table-caption\">table-caption** \n \n The element generates a **table caption box**,\n which is a [block box](#block-box) with special behavior with respect to table and table wrapper boxes.\n See [CSS2§17.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#table-display) [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2). \n \n[table-caption](#valdef-display-table-caption) boxes have a [flow-root](#valdef-display-flow-root) [inner display type](#inner-display-type).\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-ruby-base\">ruby-base**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-ruby-text\">ruby-text**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-ruby-base-container\">ruby-base-container**, **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-ruby-text-container\">ruby-text-container** \n \n The element is an **internal ruby element**.\n It generates the appropriate **internal ruby box** which participates in a [ruby formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-formatting-context). [[CSS-RUBY-1]](#biblio-css-ruby-1) \n \n[ruby-base](#valdef-display-ruby-base) and [ruby-text](#valdef-display-ruby-text) have a [flow](#valdef-display-flow) [inner display type](#inner-display-type).\n\n \n \nBoxes with layout-specific display types generate anonymous wrapper boxes around themselves\n when placed in an incompatible parent,\n as defined by their respective specifications.\n\n \n [](#example-d11b97c3) For example, Table Layout requires that a [table-cell](#valdef-display-table-cell) box\n must have a [table-row](#valdef-display-table-row) parent box. \n \nIf it is misparented, like so:\n\n```\n<div style=\"display:block;\">\n <div style=\"display:table-cell\">...</div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n \nIt will generate wrapper boxes around itself,\n producing a structure like:\n\n```\nblock box\n└anonymous table box\n └anonymous table-row-group box\n └anonymous table-row box\n └table-cell box\n\n```\n\n \nEven if the parent is another [internal table element](#internal-table-element),\n if it’s not the correct one,\n wrapper boxes will be generated.\n For example, in the following markup:\n\n```\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n <div style=\"display:table-row\">\n <div style=\"display:table-cell\">...</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n \nAnonymous wrapper box generation will produce:\n\n```\ntable box\n└anonymous table-row-group box\n └table-row box\n └table-cell box\n\n```\n\n \nThis \"fix-up\" ensures that table layout has a predictable structure to operate on.\n\n \n \n Tests\n \nThis section lacks tests.\n\n \n\n \n \n 2.5. Box Generation: the [none](#valdef-display-none) and [contents](#valdef-display-contents) keywords[](#box-generation)\n \nWhile [display](#propdef-display) can control the types of boxes an element will generate,\n it can also control whether an element will generate any boxes at all.\n\n \nThe [<display-box>](#typedef-display-box) keywords are defined as follows:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-contents\">contents** \n \n The element itself does not generate any boxes,\n but its children and pseudo-elements still generate [boxes](#box) and [text sequences](#css-text-sequence) as normal.\n For the purposes of box generation and layout,\n the element must be treated as if it had been replaced in the [element tree](#element-tree) by its contents\n (including both its source-document children and its pseudo-elements,\n such as [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) and [::after](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-after) pseudo-elements,\n which are generated before/after the element’s children as normal). \n \nNote: As only the box tree is affected,\n any semantics based on the document tree,\n such as selector-matching, event handling,\n and property [inheritance](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#inheritance),\n are not affected. As of writing, however, [this is not implemented correctly in major browsers](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3040),\n so using this feature on the Web must be done with care\n as it can prevent accessibility tools\n from accessing the element’s semantics.\n\n \nThis value computes to [display: none](#propdef-display) on replaced elements\n and other elements whose rendering is not entirely controlled by CSS;\n see [Appendix B: Effects of display: contents on Unusual Elements](#unbox) for details.\n\n \nNote: Replaced elements and form controls are treated specially\n because removing only the element’s own generating box\n is a more-or-less undefined operation.\n As this behavior may be refined if use cases\n (and more precise rendering models) develop,\n authors should use [display: none](#propdef-display) rather than display: contents on such elements for forward-compatibility.\n\n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-none\">none** \n \n The [element](#elements) and its descendants generate no [boxes](#box) or [text sequences](#css-text-sequence). \n \nSimilarly, if a [text node](#text-nodes) is defined to behave as [display: none](#propdef-display),\n it generates no [text sequences](#css-text-sequence).\n\n \n \nElements with either of these values do not have [inner](#inner-display-type) or [outer display types](#outer-display-type),\n because they don’t generate any boxes at all.\n\n \nNote: As these values cause affected elements to not generate a box,\n anonymous box generation rules will ignore the elided elements entirely,\n as if they did not exist in the box tree.\n\n \nMarkup-based relationships, however, are not affected by these values,\n as they are solely rendering-time effects. For example,\n although they may affect which table cell appears in a column,\n they do not affect which table cell is associated with a particular column element.\n Similarly, they cannot affect which HTML `[summary](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-summary-element)` element is associated with a particular table\n or whether a `[legend](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-legend-element)` is considered to be labelling the contents of a particular `[fieldset](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-fieldset-element)`. \n\n \n Tests\n \n\n

Precomposed Inline-level Display Values[](#legacy-display)\n \nCSS level 2 used a single-keyword syntax for [display](#propdef-display),\n requiring separate keywords for block-level and inline-level variants of the same layout mode.\n These [<display-legacy>](#typedef-display-legacy) keywords map as follows:\n\n \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-inline-block\">inline-block** \n Computes to inline flow-root. \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-inline-table\">inline-table** \n Computes to inline table. \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-inline-flex\">inline-flex** \n Computes to inline flex. \n **\" data-dfn-type=\"value\" data-export id=\"valdef-display-inline-grid\">inline-grid** \n Computes to inline grid. \n \n \nNote: Although these keywords and their equivalents compute to the same value,\n their [specified values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value) remain distinct.\n\n \nNote: The [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle) serialization rules\n will always output these precomposed keywords\n rather than the equivalent two-keyword pairs\n due to the [shortest, most backwards-compatible serialization principle](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values).\n\n \n Tests\n \nThis section lacks tests.\n\n \n\n \n \n 2.7. Automatic Box Type Transformations[](#transformations)\n \nSome layout effects require **blockification** or **inlinification** of the box type,\n which sets the box’s [computed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) [outer display type](#outer-display-type) to [block](#valdef-display-block) or [inline](#valdef-display-inline) (respectively).\n (This has no effect on [display types](#display-type) that generate no box at all,\n such as [none](#valdef-display-none) or [contents](#valdef-display-contents).)\n Additionally:\n\n \n\n \n \nIf a [block box](#block-box) (block flow) is [inlinified](#inlinify),\nits [inner display type](#inner-display-type) is set to [flow-root](#valdef-display-flow-root) so that it remains a block container.\n\n \n \nIf an [inline box](#inline-box) (inline flow) is [inlinified](#inlinify),\nit recursively inlinifies all of its in-flow children,\nso that no block-level descendants\nbreak up the inline formatting context in which it participates.\n\n \n \nFor legacy reasons,\nif an [inline block box](#inline-block) (inline flow-root)\nis [blockified](#blockify),\nit becomes a [block](#valdef-display-block) box\n(losing its [flow-root](#valdef-display-flow-root) nature).\nFor consistency,\na run-in flow-root box\nalso blockifies to a block box.\n\n \n \nIf a [layout-internal](#layout-internal) box is [blockified](#blockify),\nits [inner display type](#inner-display-type) converts to [flow](#valdef-display-flow) so that it becomes a [block container](#block-container). [Inlinification](#inlinify) has no effect on layout-internal boxes.\n(However, placement in such an inline context\nwill typically cause them to be wrapped\nin an appropriately-typed anonymous inline-level box.)\n\n \n\n \nNote: There are two methods used to fix up box types when a box is mismatched to its context.\n One is transformation of the [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of [display](#propdef-display), such as [blockification](#blockify) and [inlinification](#inlinify) described here.\n The other, taking place during [box tree construction](#intro) (after computed values have been determined),\n is the creation of intermediary anonymous boxes,\n such as happens in [tables](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#anonymous-boxes), [ruby](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#box-fixup),\n and [flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#box-gen) layout.\n\n \n [](#example-26cc3423) Some examples of computed-value fixup include: \n \n\n Absolute positioning or floating an element [blockifies](#blockify) the box’s display type. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) \n Containment in a [ruby container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-container) [inlinifies](#inlinify) the box’s display type, as described in [[CSS-RUBY-1]](#biblio-css-ruby-1). \n A parent with a [grid](#valdef-display-grid) or [flex](#valdef-display-flex) [display](#propdef-display) value [blockifies](#blockify) the box’s display type. [[CSS-GRID-1]](#biblio-css-grid-1) [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]](#biblio-css-flexbox-1) \n \n\n \n 2.8. The Root Element’s Principal Box[](#root)\n \nThe [root element](#root-element)’s display type is always [blockified](#blockify),\n and its [principal box](#principal-box) always establishes an [independent formatting context](#independent-formatting-context).\n This box’s [containing block](#containing-block) is the [initial containing block](#initial-containing-block).\n\n \nAdditionally, a [display](#propdef-display) of [contents](#valdef-display-contents) computes to [block](#valdef-display-block) on the root element.\n\n 2.9. Animating and Interpolating [display](#propdef-display)[](#display-animation)\n \nIn general,\n the [display](#propdef-display) property’s [animation type](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#animation-type) is [discrete](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#discrete).\n However,\n similar to interpolation of [visibility](#propdef-visibility) (see [Web Animations §  Animation of visibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#animating-visibility)),\n during interpolation between [none](#valdef-display-none) and any other display value, p values between 0 and 1\n map to the non-none value.\n Additionally,\n the element is [inert](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#inert) as long as its display value would compute to none when ignoring the Transitions and Animations [cascade origins](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-6/#origin).",

Reordering and Accessibility[](#order-accessibility)\n \nThe [order](#propdef-order) property does not affect ordering in non-visual media\n (such as [speech](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/)).\n Likewise, order does not affect\n the default traversal order of sequential navigation modes\n (such as cycling through links, see e.g. [`tabindex`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#attr-tabindex) [[HTML]](#biblio-html)).\n\n \n Authors must use [order](#propdef-order) only for spatial, not logical, reordering of content.\n Style sheets that use order to perform logical reordering are non-conforming.\n\n \nNote: This is so that non-visual media and non-CSS UAs,\n which typically present content linearly,\n can rely on a logical source order,\n while [order](#propdef-order) is used to tailor the layout order.\n (Since visual perception is two-dimensional and non-linear,\n the desired layout order is not always logical.)\n\n \nIn order to preserve the author’s intended ordering in all presentation modes,\n authoring tools—​including WYSIWYG editors as well as Web-based authoring aids—​must reorder the underlying document source\n and not use [order](#propdef-order) to perform reordering\n unless the author has explicitly indicated that\n the spatial order should be out-of-sync with\n the underlying document order (which determines speech and navigation order).\n\n \n [](#example-b20b6e0a) For example, a tool might offer both drag-and-drop reordering of flex items\n as well as handling of media queries for alternate layouts per screen size range. \n \nSince most of the time, reordering should affect all screen ranges\n as well as navigation and speech order,\n the tool would perform drag-and-drop reordering at the DOM layer.\n In some cases, however, the author may want different layouts per screen size.\n The tool could offer this functionality by using [order](#propdef-order) together with media queries,\n but also tie the smallest screen size’s ordering to the underlying DOM order\n (since this is most likely to be a logical linear presentation order)\n while using order to define the visual presentation order in other size ranges.\n\n \nThis tool would be conformant, whereas a tool that only ever used [order](#propdef-order) to handle drag-and-drop reordering\n (however convenient it might be to implement it that way)\n would be non-conformant.\n\n \n \nNote: User agents, including browsers, accessible technology, and extensions,\n may offer spatial navigation features.\n This section does not preclude respecting the [order](#propdef-order) property\n when determining element ordering in such spatial navigation modes;\n indeed it would need to be considered for such a feature to work.\n But order is not the only (or even the primary) CSS property\n that would need to be considered for such a spatial navigation feature.\n A well-implemented spatial navigation feature would need to consider\n all the layout features of CSS that modify spatial relationships.",

}\n\n.wrapper > a { display: block; }\n\n.wrapper a:nth-child(3){ reading-order: -1; }\n\n```\n\n \n \n The source document should express\n the underlying logical order of elements.\n The [reading-flow](#propdef-reading-flow) and [reading-order](#propdef-reading-order) properties exist for cases where a given document\n can have multiple reading orders depending on layout changes,\n e.g. in response to [media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#media-query).\n In such cases, the most common or most fundamental reading order\n should be encoded in the source order\n so that the document is sensical without CSS.\n\n \n Design Considerations and Background\n \nSome of the considerations that went into the design\n of [reading-flow](#propdef-reading-flow) are:\n\n \n\n \n \nThere are clear use cases for disconnecting\nthe reading and navigation order from the box layout order,\nthe most fundamental of which is to make sure\nthe reading and navigation order matches the visual perception order when it is not the same as the box layout order.\n(Visual perception is non-linear, and is influenced by things like\n the size, color contrast, and spacing of a visual element,\n not just its spatial coordinates on the page.)\n\n \n \nIt is a [core principle of Web platform architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pci),\nin order to allow content to be accessible to the widest possible audience\nacross devices that exist now and in the future,\nfor the underlying document to be sensical independent of CSS.\nTherefore the underlying document order\nshould represent a logical ordering of its elements\nregardless of its visual presentation.\n\n \n \nFor components of a page that do not have a strong inherent order,\na document can have multiple visual presentations with different layouts,\nall conveying the same semantic information.\nIt should be possible for all of these presentations to have good accessibility.\n\n \n \nLinear navigation, focus sequencing order, and screen-reader order\nshould always match, because there are users who use them together.\n\n \n \nEach component or hierarchical level of a page\ncan have different requirements for reordering,\nso CSS reordering controls should not lend themselves\ntoo easily to blanket use\n(like [box-sizing](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-box-sizing))\nrather than tailored use\n(like [flow-relative vs. physical properties and values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-logical/)).\n\n \n\n \n \n Tests\n \n\n [reading-flow-computed.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-computed.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-computed.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-computed.html)\n [reading-flow-invalid.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-invalid.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-invalid.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-invalid.html)\n [reading-flow-valid.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-valid.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-valid.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-flow-valid.html)\n [reading-order-computed.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-computed.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-computed.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-computed.html)\n [reading-order-invalid.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-invalid.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-invalid.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-invalid.html)\n [reading-order-valid.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-valid.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-valid.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-display/reading-flow/tentative/reading-order-valid.html)\n \n\n \n \n[](#issue-4bdf582b) DOM needs a convenient reordering function\n so that authors (even authors who don’t usually write JS)\n can easily perform source order reordering when necessary\n instead of misusing [order](#propdef-order) or [reading-flow](#propdef-reading-flow).

[Invisible](#invisible-box) boxes still affect layout.\n (Set the [display](#propdef-display) property to [none](#valdef-display-none) to suppress box generation altogether.).\n Values have the following meanings:\n\n \n **visible** \n The generated box is visible, as normal. \n **hidden** \n Any boxes generated by the element are [invisible](#invisible-box).\n Descendants of the element can, however, be visible\n if they have [visibility: visible](#propdef-visibility). \n **force-hidden** \n Any boxes generated by the element and its descendants are [invisible](#invisible-box) (regardless of their [visibility](#propdef-visibility) value). \n **collapse** \n Indicates that the box is **collapsed**,\n which can cause it to take up less space than otherwise\n in a formatting-context–specific way.\n See [dynamic row and column effects in tables](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#dynamic-effects) [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) and [collapsed flex items](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#visibility-collapse) in flex layout [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]](#biblio-css-flexbox-1).\n In all other cases, however,\n (i.e. unless otherwise specified)\n this simply makes the box [invisible](#invisible-box),\n just like [hidden](#valdef-visibility-hidden). \n \n \nNote: Currently, many user agents and/or accessibility tools\n don’t correctly implement the accessibility implications of\n visible elements with semantic relationships to [invisible](#invisible-box) elements,\n so, for example,\n making parent elements with special roles (such as table rows) invisible while leaving child elements with special roles (such as table cells) visible\n can be problematic for users of those tools.\n Authors should avoid creating these situations\n until the tooling situation improves.\n\n \n**Invisible boxes** are not rendered\n (as if they were fully transparent),\n cannot be interacted with\n (and behave as if they had [pointer-events: none](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#propdef-pointer-events)),\n are removed from navigation\n (similar to [display: none](#propdef-display)),\n and are also not rendered to speech\n (except when [speak](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#propdef-speak) is [always](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#valdef-speak-always) [[CSS-SPEECH-1]](#biblio-css-speech-1)).\n However, as with display: contents,\n their semantic role as a container is not affected,\n to ensure that any [visible](#valdef-visibility-visible) descendants\n are properly interpreted.\n\n \nNote: If [speak](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#propdef-speak) is [always](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#valdef-speak-always),\n an otherwise [invisible](#invisible-box) box is rendered to speech,\n and may be interacted with using non-visual/spatial methods.\n\n \n [](#example-a0db1b94) While temporarily hiding things with [display: none](#propdef-display) is often sufficient,\n doing so removes the elements from layout entirely,\n possibly causing unwanted movement or reflow of the page\n when an element is hidden or shown. [visibility: hidden](#propdef-visibility) can instead be used\n to keep the page’s layout stable\n as something is hidden and displayed. \n \nFor example,\n here is a (deliberately simplified) possible implementation of a \"spoiler\" element\n that can be revealed by clicking on the hidden text:\n\n```\n<p>The symbolism earlier in the movie becomes obvious at the end,\n when it's revealed that <spoiler-text><span>Luke is his own father</span></spoiler-text>,\n making the wizard's cryptic riddles meaningful.\n<style>\nspoiler-text { border-bottom: 1px solid; }\nspoiler-text > span { visibility: hidden; }\nspoiler-text.shown > span { visibility: visible; }\n</style>\n<script>\n[...document.querySelectorAll(\"spoiler-text\")].forEach(el=>{\n el.addEventListener(\"click\", e=>el.classList.toggle(\"shown\"));\n});\n</script>\n\n```\n\n \n This example is deliberately significantly simplified.\n It is missing a number of accessibility and UX features\n that a well-designed spoiler element would have\n to show off the [visibility](#propdef-visibility) usage more plainly.\n Don’t copy this code for a real site.\n\n \n \n Tests\n \nThis section lacks tests.",

      "content": "A **run-in box** is a box that merges into a block that comes after it,\n inserting itself at the beginning of that block’s inline-level content.\n This is useful for formatting compact headlines, definitions, and other similar things,\n where the appropriate DOM structure is to have a headline preceding the following prose,\n but the desired display is an inline headline laying out with the text.\n\n \n [](#example-8e61beaa) For example, dictionary definitions are often formatted so that the word is inline with the definition: \n\n```\n<dl class='dict'>\n <dt>dictionary\n <dd>a book that lists the words of a language in alphabetical\n order and gives their meaning, or that gives the equivalent\n words in a different language.\n <dt>glossary\n <dd>an alphabetical list of terms or words found in or relating\n to a specific subject, text, or dialect, with explanations; a\n brief dictionary.\n</dl>\n<style>\n.dict > dt {\n display: run-in;\n}\n.dict > dt::after {\n content: \": \"\n}\n</style>\n\n```\n\n \nWhich is formatted as:\n\n```\ndictionary: a book that lists the words of a language\nin alphabetical order and explains their meaning.\n\nglossary: an alphabetical list of terms or words found\nin or relating to a specific subject, text, or dialect,\nwith explanations; a brief dictionary.\n\n```\n\n \n \nA [run-in box](#run-in) behaves exactly as any other [inline-level box](#inline-level-box), except:\n\n \n\n A [run-in box](#run-in) with a [flow](#valdef-display-flow) [inner display type](#inner-display-type) [inlinifies](#inlinify) its contents. \n \n If a [run-in sequence](#run-in-sequence) is immediately followed by a block box\n that does not establish a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context),\n it is inserted as direct children of that block box:\n after its [::marker](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-marker) pseudo-element’s boxes (if any),\n but preceding any other boxes generated by the contents of the block\n (including the box generated by the [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) pseudo-element, if any).\n This re-parenting recurses if possible\n (so that the run-in effectively becomes\n part of the deepest subsequent “paragraph” in its formatting context,\n collecting newly-adjacent run-ins as it goes). \n \nThe reparented content is then formatted as if originally parented there. Note that only layout is affected, not inheritance,\n because property inheritance for non-anonymous boxes is based only on the element tree.\n\n Otherwise\n (if the [run-in sequence](#run-in-sequence) is not followed by such a block),\n an anonymous block box is generated around the run-in sequence and all immediately following inline-level content\n (up to, but not including, the next run-in sequence, if any). \n \n\n \nA **run-in sequence** is a maximal sequence of consecutive sibling [run-in boxes](#run-in) and intervening [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#white-space) and/or out-of-flow boxes.\n\n \nNote: This statement implies that out-of-flow boxes are reparented\n if they are between two run-in boxes.\n Another alternative would be to leave behind the intervening out-of-flow boxes,\n or to have out-of-flow boxes impede the running-in of earlier boxes.\n Implementers and authors are encouraged to contact the CSSWG if they have a preferred behavior, as this one was picked somewhat at random.\n\n \nThis fixup occurs before the anonymous block and inline box fixup described in [CSS2§9.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#box-gen),\n and affects the determination of the [first formatted line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#first-formatted-line) of the affected elements\n as if the [run-in sequence](#run-in-sequence) were originally\n in its final location in the box tree.\n\n \nNote: As the earliest run-in represents the first text on the [first formatted line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#first-formatted-line) of its containing block,\n a [::first-letter](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-letter) pseudo-element applied to that block element\n selects the first letter of the run-in,\n rather than the first letter of its own contents.\n\n \nNote: This run-in model is slightly different from the one proposed in earlier revisions of [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2).\n\n \n Tests\n \n\n [display-change-iframe.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-display/display-change-iframe.html) [(live

      "content": "The following terms are defined here for convenience:\n\n \n **root element** \n The [element](#elements) at the root of the [document tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-tree).\n In a document tree produced under the DOM,\n this is the [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element);\n in HTML it is the `[html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-html-element)` element. [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) [[HTML]](#biblio-html) \n **principal box** \n \n When an [element](#elements) generates one or more [boxes](#box),\n one of them is the [principal box](#principal-box),\n which contains its descendant boxes and generated content,\n and is also the box involved in any positioning scheme. \n \nSome elements may generate additional boxes in addition to the principal box\n (such as [list-item](#valdef-display-list-item) elements,\n which generate an additional marker box,\n or [table](#valdef-display-table) elements,\n which generate a [principal](#principal-box) [table wrapper box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables-3/#table-wrapper-box) and an additional [table grid box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables-3/#table-grid-box)).\n These additional boxes are placed with respect to the principal box.\n\n **inline-level** \n Content that participates in inline layout.\n Specifically, inline-level boxes and [text sequences](#css-text-sequence). \n **block-level** \n Content that participates in [block layout](#block-layout).\n Specifically, block-level boxes. \n **inline box** \n A non-replaced [inline-level](#inline-level) box whose [inner display type](#inner-display-type) is [flow](#valdef-display-flow).\n The contents of an inline box participate in the same inline formatting context as the inline box itself. \n **inline** \n Used as a shorthand for [inline box](#inline-box) or [inline-level box](#inline-level-box) where unambiguous,\n or as an adjective meaning [inline-level](#inline-level).\n The latter usage is deprecated. \n **atomic inline** \n \n An inline-level box that is replaced (such as an image)\n or that establishes a new formatting context (such as an [inline-block](#valdef-display-inline-block) or [inline-table](#valdef-display-inline-table))\n and cannot split across lines\n (as [inline boxes](#inline-box) and [ruby containers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-container) can). \n \nAny inline-level box whose [inner display type](#inner-display-type) is not [flow](#valdef-display-flow) establishes a new formatting context of the specified inner display type.\n\n **block container** \n \n A block container either contains only inline-level boxes\n participating in an [inline formatting context](#inline-formatting-context),\n or contains only block-level boxes\n participating in a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) (possibly generating anonymous block boxes to ensure this constraint,\n as defined in [CSS2§9.2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level)). \n \nA block container that contains only inline-level content\n establishes a new [inline formatting context](#inline-formatting-context).\n The element then also generates a [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box) which wraps all of its inline content. Note, this [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box) concept\n effectively replaces the \"anonymous inline element\" concept\n introduced in [CSS2§9.2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#anonymous).\n\n \nA block container establishes a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) if its parent formatting context is not a block formatting context;\n otherwise, when participating in a block formatting context itself,\n it either establishes a new block formatting context for its contents\n or continues the one in which it participates,\n as determined by the constraints of other properties\n (such as [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#propdef-overflow) or [align-content](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#propdef-align-content)).\n\n \nNote: A block container box can both establish a block formatting context and an inline formatting context simultaneously.\n\n **block box** \n \n A [block-level box](#block-level-box) that is also a [block container](#block-container). \n \nNote: Not all [block container](#block-container) boxes are [block-level](#block-level) boxes:\n non-replaced [inline blocks](#inline-block) and non-replaced table cells,\n for example, are block containers\n but not block-level boxes.\n Similarly, not all block-level boxes are block containers:\n block-level replaced elements ([display: block](#propdef-display))\n and flex containers (display: flex), for example,\n are not block containers.\n\n **block** \n Used as a shorthand for [block box](#block-box), [block-level box](#block-level-box), or [block container box](#block-container),\n where unambiguous. \n **replaced element** \n \n An element whose content is outside the scope of the CSS formatting model,\n such as an image or embedded document. For example, the content of the HTML `[img](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element)` element\n is often replaced by the image that its `[src](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#attr-img-src)` attribute designates. \n \nReplaced elements often have [natural dimensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#natural-dimensions).\n For example, a bitmap image has a natural width and a natural height specified in absolute units\n (from which the natural ratio can obviously be determined).\n On the other hand, other objects may not have any natural dimensions\n (for example, a blank HTML document).\n See [[css-images-3]](#biblio-css-images-3).\n\n \nUser agents may consider a [replaced element](#replaced-element) to not have any [natural dimensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#natural-dimensions) if it is believed that those dimensions could leak sensitive information to a third party.\n For example, if an HTML document changed natural size depending on the user’s bank balance,\n then the UA might want to act as if that resource had no natural dimensions.\n\n \nThe content of replaced elements is not considered in the CSS formatting model;\n however, their [natural dimensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-3/#natural-dimensions) are used in various layout calculations.\n Replaced elements always establish an [independent formatting context](#independent-formatting-context).\n\n \nA **non-replaced** element is one that is not [replaced](#replaced-element),\n i.e. whose rendering is dictated by the CSS model.\n\n **containing block** \n \n A rectangle that forms the basis of sizing and positioning\n for the [boxes](#box) associated with it.\n Notably, a [containing block](#containing-block) is not a [box](#box) (it is a rectangle),\n however it is often derived from the dimensions of a box.\n Each box is given a position with respect to its containing block,\n but it is not confined by this containing block;\n it can [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#overflow).\n The phrase “a box’s containing block” means\n “the containing block in which the box lives,”\n not the one it generates. \n \nIn general, the [edges](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#box-box-edge) of a [box](#box) act as the [containing block](#containing-block) for descendant boxes;\n we say that a box “establishes”\n the containing block for its descendants.\n If properties of a containing block are referenced,\n they reference the values on the box that generated the containing block.\n (For the [initial containing block](#initial-containing-block),\n values are taken from the root element\n unless otherwise specified.)\n\n \nSee [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) [Section 9.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block) and [Section 10.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details) and [CSS Positioned Layout 3 § 2.1 Containing Blocks of Positioned Boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#def-cb) for details.\n\n **containing block chain** \n A sequence of successive [containing blocks](#containing-block) that form an ancestor-descendant chain\n through the containing block relation.\n For example, an [inline box](#inline-box)’s containing block is the content box of its closest [block container](#block-container) ancestor;\n if that block container is an in-flow [block](#block),\n then its containing block is formed by its parent block container;\n if that grandparent block container is [absolutely positioned](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#absolute-position),\n then its containing block is the padding edges of its closest positioned ancestor (not necessarily its parent),\n and so on up to the [initial containing block](#initial-containing-block). \n **initial containing block** \n The [containing block](#containing-block) of the [root element](#root-element).\n The [initial containing block](#initial-containing-block) establishes a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context).\n See [CSS2.1§10.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details) for [continuous media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#continuous-media);\n and [[CSS-PAGE-3]](#biblio-css-page-3) for [paged media](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#paged-media) for its position and dimensions. \n **formatting context** \n \n A [formatting context](#formatting-context) is the environment\n into which a set of related boxes are laid out.\n Different formatting contexts lay out their boxes\n according to different rules.\n For example, a [flex formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-formatting-context) lays out boxes according to the [flex layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-layout) rules [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]](#biblio-css-flexbox-1),\n whereas a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) lays out boxes according to the block-and-inline layout rules [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2).\n Additionally, some types of formatting contexts interleave and co-exist:\n for example, an [inline formatting context](#inline-formatting-context) exists within\n and interacts with the block formatting context of the element that establishes it,\n and a [ruby container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-container) overlays a [ruby formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-formatting-context) over the inline formatting context in which its [ruby base container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-base-container-box) participates. \n \nA box either establishes a new [independent formatting context](#independent-formatting-context) or continues the [formatting context](#formatting-context) of its containing block.\n In some cases,\n it might additionally establish a new (non-independent) co-existing formatting context.\n Unless otherwise specified, however,\n establishing a new formatting context creates an independent formatting context.\n The type of formatting context established by the box\n is determined by its [inner display type](#inner-display-type).\n E.g. a [grid container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-container) establishes a new [grid formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-formatting-context),\n a [ruby container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-container) establishes a new [ruby formatting context](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#ruby-formatting-context),\n and a [block container](#block-container) can establish a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) and/or a new [inline formatting context](#inline-formatting-context).\n See the [display](#propdef-display) property.\n\n **independent formatting context** \n \n When a box establishes an independent formatting context\n (whether that [formatting context](#formatting-context) is of the same type as its parent or not),\n it essentially creates a new, independent layout environment:\n except through the sizing of the box itself,\n the layout of its descendants is (generally)\n not affected by the rules and contents of\n the formatting context outside the box, and vice versa. \n \n[](#example-7e2994e7) For example, in a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context),\n floated boxes affect the layout of surrounding boxes.\n But their effects do not escape their [formatting context](#formatting-context):\n the box establishing their formatting context grows to fully contain them,\n and floats from outside that box\n are not allowed to protrude into and affect the contents\n inside the box. \n\n \n[](#example-bb8209a6) As another example, margins do not collapse across [formatting context](#formatting-context) boundaries. \n\n \n Exclusions are able to affect content across [independent formatting context](#independent-formatting-context) boundaries.\n (At time of writing, they are the only layout feature that can.) [[CSS3-EXCLUSIONS]](#biblio-css3-exclusions) \n\n \nCertain properties can force a box to ** establish an independent formatting context** in cases where it wouldn’t ordinarily.\n For example,\n making a box [out-of-flow](#out-of-flow) causes it to [blockify](#blockify) as well as to [establish an independent formatting context](#establish-an-independent-formatting-context).\n As another example,\n certain values of the [contain](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-2/#propdef-contain) property\n can cause a box to establish an independent formatting context.\n Turning a block into a [scroll container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scroll-container) will cause it to establish an independent formatting context;\n however turning a [subgrid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrid) into a scroll container will not—​it continues to act as a subgrid,\n with its contents participating in the layout of its parent [grid container](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#grid-container).\n\n \nA [block box](#block-box) that [establishes an independent formatting context](#establish-an-independent-formatting-context) establishes a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) for its contents.\n In most other cases,\n forcing a box to establish an independent formatting context is a no-op—​either the box already establishes an [independent formatting context](#independent-formatting-context) (e.g. [flex containers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-container)),\n or it’s not possible to establish a totally independent new formatting context on that type of box\n (e.g. non-replaced [inline boxes](#inline-box)).\n\n **block formatting context** \n **inline formatting context** \n [Block](#block-formatting-context) and [inline formatting contexts](#inline-formatting-context) are defined in [CSS 2.1 Section 9.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#normal-flow). Inline formatting contexts exist within\n (are part of their containing) block formatting contexts;\n for example, line boxes belonging to the inline formatting context interact with floats belonging to the block formatting context. \n **block layout** \n The layout of [block-level boxes](#block-level-box),\n performed within a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context). \n **block formatting context root** \n A [block container](#block-container) that establishes a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context). \n **BFC** \n \n Abbreviation for [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) or [block formatting context root](#block-formatting-context-root).\n Has various informal definitions referring to boxes which\n contain internal floats, exclude external floats, and suppress margin collapsing,\n and may therefore refer specifically to one of: \n \n\n \n \na [block container](#block-container) that establishes a new [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) for its contents\n\n \n \na [block box](#block-box) (i.e. a [block-level](#block-level) block container)\nthat establishes a [block formatting context](#block-formatting-context) for its contents\n(as distinguished from a block box which does not)\n\n \n \n(very loosely) any block-level box that establishes a new [formatting context](#formatting-context) (other than an inline formatting context)\n\n \n\n **out-of-flow** \n **in-flow** \n \n A box is [out-of-flow](#out-of-flow) if it is\n extracted from its expected position and interaction with surrounding content\n and laid out using a different paradigm\n outside the normal flow of content in its parent formatting context.\n This occurs if the box is floated (via [float](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-float))\n or [absolutely positioned](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#absolute-position) (via [position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#propdef-position)).\n A box is [in-flow](#in-flow) if it is not out-of-flow. \n \nNote: Some [formatting contexts](#formatting-context) inhibit floating,\n so that an element with [float: left](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-float) is not necessarily [out-of-flow](#out-of-flow).\n\n **document order** \n The order in which boxes or content occurs in the document\n (which can be different from the order in which it appears for rendering).\n For the purpose of determining the relative order of pseudo-elements,\n the box-tree order is used,\n see [CSS Pseudo-Elements 4 § 4 Tree-Abiding Pseudo-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#treelike). \n \n \nSee [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) [Chapter 9](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html) for a fuller definition of these terms.",

[display: contents](#propdef-display) simply removes their [principal box](#principal-box),\nand their contents render as normal.\n\n any other HTML element\n \n \nBehaves as normal for [display: contents](#propdef-display).\n\n \n SVG Elements[](#unbox-svg)\n \n An `[svg](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-svg)` element that has CSS box layout\n(this includes all `[svg](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-svg)` whose parent is an HTML element,\nas well as document root elements)\n \n \n[display: contents](#propdef-display) computes to display: none.\n\n All other SVG [container elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#container-element) that are also [renderable elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/render.html#TermRenderableElement)\n SVG [text content child elements](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#TermTextContentChildElement)\n `[use](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-use)`\n \n \n[display: contents](#propdef-display) strips the element from the formatting tree,\nand hoists its contents up to display in its place.\nThese contents include the shadow-DOM content for `[use](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-use)`.\n\n any other SVG elements\n \n \n[display: contents](#propdef-display) computes to display: none.\n\n \n \n The intention here is that\n the [display: none](#propdef-display) behavior applies\n whenever the \"rendering context\" inside the element\n is different than the context outside of it.\n If the element’s child elements would not be valid children\n of the element’s parent,\n you cannot simply hoist them up the formatting tree. \n \nFor example, text content and text formatting elements in SVG\n require a `[text](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#elementdef-text)` element context;\n if you remove a `[text](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#elementdef-text)`,\n its child text content and elements are no longer valid.\n For that reason, [display: contents](#propdef-display) on `[text](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#elementdef-text)` prevents the entire text element from being rendered.\n In contrast, any valid content inside a `[tspan](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#elementdef-tspan)` or `[textPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#elementdef-textPath)` is also valid content inside the parent text formatting context,\n so the hoisting behavior applies for these elements.\n\n \nSimilarly, if hoisting would convert the children from [non-rendered elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/render.html#TermNonRenderedElement) (e.g., a shape inside a `[pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html#elementdef-pattern)` or `[symbol](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-symbol)`)\n to [rendered elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/render.html#TermRenderedElement) (e.g., a shape that is a direct child of the `[svg](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#elementdef-svg)`),\n that is an invalid change of rendering context.\n Never-rendered container elements therefore cannot be \"un-boxed\"\n by [display: contents](#propdef-display).\n\n \n \nWhen an element is stripped from the formatting tree,\n then any SVG attributes on that element\n that control layout and visual formatting\n are ignored when rendering the contents.\n However, SVG [presentation attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/styling.html#TermPresentationAttribute)—​which map to CSS properties—​continue to affect value processing and inheritance [[CSS-CASCADE-3]](#biblio-css-cascade-3);\n thus such attributes can affect\n the layout and visual formatting of the element’s descendants\n by influencing the values of such properties on those descendants.\n\n MathML Elements[](#unbox-mathml)\n \nFor all MathML elements, [display: contents](#propdef-display) computes to display: none.",
