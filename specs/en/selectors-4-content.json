      "content": "3.1. Structure and Terminology[](#structure)\n \nA **selector** represents\n a particular pattern of element(s) in a tree structure.\n The term [selector](#selector) can refer to a [simple selector](#simple), [compound selector](#compound), [complex selector](#complex), or [selector list](#selector-list).\n The **subject of a selector** is\n any element that selector is defined to be about;\n that is, any element **matching** that selector.\n\n \nA **simple selector** is a single condition on an element.\n A [type selector](#type-selector), [universal selector](#universal-selector), [attribute selector](#attribute-selector), [class selector](#class-selector), [ID selector](#id-selector),\n or [pseudo-class](#pseudo-class) is a [simple selector](#simple).\n (It is represented by [<simple-selector>](#typedef-simple-selector) in the selectors [grammar](#grammar).)\n A given element is said to [match](#match) a simple selector when that simple selector,\n as defined in this specification and in accordance with the [document language](#document-language),\n accurately describes the element.\n\n \nA **compound selector** is a sequence of [simple selectors](#simple) that are not separated by a [combinator](#selector-combinator),\n and represents a set of simultaneous conditions on a single element.\n If it contains a [type selector](#type-selector) or [universal selector](#universal-selector),\n that selector must come first in the sequence.\n Only one type selector or universal selector is allowed in the sequence.\n (A [compound selector](#compound) is represented by [<compound-selector>](#typedef-compound-selector) in the selectors [grammar](#grammar).)\n A given element is said to [match](#match) a compound selector when it matches all simple selectors in the compound selector.\n\n \nNote: As whitespace represents the [descendant combinator](#descendant-combinator),\n no whitespace is allowed between the [simple selectors](#simple) in a [compound selector](#compound).\n\n \nA **pseudo-compound selector** is a [pseudo-element](#pseudo-element) selector,\n optionally followed by additional [pseudo-class](#pseudo-class) selectors,\n and optionally preceded by a [compound selector](#compound) or another [pseudo-compound selector](#pseudo-compound),\n without any [combinators](#selector-combinator).\n (A pseudo-compound selector is represented by [<pseudo-compound-selector>](#typedef-pseudo-compound-selector) in the selectors [grammar](#grammar).)\n A pseudo-element [matches](#match) a pseudo-compound selector when it has the specified pseudo-element name,\n matches the additional conditions represented by any pseudo-classes,\n and has an [originating element](#originating-element) represented by the adjacent preceding selector.\n If there is no adjacent preceding selector,\n the [universal selector](#universal-selector) is assumed.\n (For example, .foo ::before is equivalent to .foo *::before,\n and distinct from .foo::before.)\n\n [](#example-9e91e72f) For example, in .foo::before:hover,\n the .foo is a [compound selector](#compound),\n while the ::before:hover is a [pseudo-compound selector](#pseudo-compound).\n However, in .foo::before::marker, [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) and [::marker](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-marker) are separate pseudo-compound selectors. \n \nNote: A [pseudo-compound selector](#pseudo-compound) is not a [compound selector](#compound),\n and can’t be used in places that expect a compound selector only. Pseudo-compound selectors act as if they carry a [combinator](#selector-combinator) with themselves,\n expressing their relationship with their [originating element](#originating-element),\n just as the [>](#selectordef-child) combinator\n expresses a relationship with a parent element.\n\n \nA **combinator** is a condition of relationship between two elements\n represented by the [compound selectors](#compound) on either side.\n Combinators in Selectors Level 4 include:\n the [descendant combinator](#descendant-combinator) (white space),\n the [child combinator](#child-combinator) (U+003E, `>`),\n the [next-sibling combinator](#next-sibling-combinator) (U+002B, `+`),\n and the [subsequent-sibling combinator](#subsequent-sibling-combinator) (U+007E, `~`).\n Two given elements are said to [match](#match) a [combinator](#selector-combinator) when the condition of relationship between these elements is true.\n\n \nA **complex selector** is\n a sequence of one or more [compound selectors](#compound) and/or [pseudo-compound selectors](#pseudo-compound),\n with compound selectors separated by [combinators](#selector-combinator).\n It represents a set of simultaneous conditions\n on a set of elements in the particular relationships\n described by its combinators.\n (Complex selectors are represented by [<complex-selector>](#typedef-complex-selector) in the selectors [grammar](#grammar).)\n A given element or pseudo-element\n is said to [match](#match) a [complex selector](#complex) when it matches the final compound/pseudo-compound selector in the sequence,\n and every preceding unit of the sequence also matches an element or [pseudo-element](#pseudo-element),\n with the correct relationship between consecutive units\n as expressed by the combinators separating them\n (or, for pseudo-compound selectors,\n the correct [originating element](#originating-element) relationship).\n\n \n [](#example-3e6d4159) For example, .foo.bar matches an element\n with both \"foo\" and \"bar\" classes. \n \n.ancestor > .foo.bar matches a subset of those elements:\n only those whose parent element\n (as indicated by the [>](#selectordef-child) combinator)\n has the \"ancestor\" class.\n\n \n.foo.bar::before matches a [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) pseudo-element,\n whose [originating element](#originating-element) matches .foo.bar.\n\n \n \nA **list of simple/compound/complex selectors** is a comma-separated list of [simple](#simple), [compound](#compound),\n or [complex selectors](#complex).\n This is also called just a **selector list** when the type is either unimportant or specified in the surrounding prose;\n if the type is important and unspecified,\n it defaults to meaning a [list of complex selectors](#list-of-simple-selectors).\n (See [§ 4.1 Selector Lists](#grouping) for additional information on [selector lists](#selector-list) and the various <*-selector-list> productions in the [grammar](#grammar) for their formal syntax.)\n A given element is said to [match](#match) a selector list when it matches any (at least one) of the [selectors](#selector) in that selector list.\n\n 3.2. Data Model[](#data-model)\n \nSelectors are evaluated against an element tree such as the DOM. [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) Within this specification,\n this may be referred to as the \"document tree\" or \"source document\".\n\n \nEach element may have any of the following five aspects,\n which can be selected against,\n all of which are matched as strings:\n\n \n\n The element’s type (also known as its tag name). \n The element’s namespace. \n An ID. \n Classes (named groups) to which it belongs. \n Attributes, which are name-value pairs. \n \n\n \nMany of the selectors depend on the semantics of the **document language** (i.e. the language and semantics of the document tree)\n and/or the semantics of the **host language** (i.e. the language that is using selectors syntax).\n For example, the [:lang()](#lang-pseudo) selector depends on the [document language](#document-language) (e.g. HTML)\n to define how an element is associated with a language.\n As a slightly different example, the [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) pseudo-element\n depends on the [host language](#host-language) (e.g. CSS)\n to define what a ::first-line pseudo-element represents\n and what it can do.\n\n 3.2.1.

Scoped Selectors[](#scoping)\n \nSome host applications may choose to **scope** selectors\n to a particular subtree or fragment of the document,\n The root of the scoping subtree is called the **scoping root**.\n\n \nWhen a selector is [scoped](#scoped-selector),\n it matches an element only if the element is a descendant of the [scoping root](#scoping-root).\n (The rest of the selector can match unrestricted;\n it’s only the final matched elements that must be within the scope.)\n\n \n [](#example-32ec254f) For example,\n the querySelector() method defined in [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) allows the author to evaluate a [scoped](#scoped-selector) selector\n relative to the element it’s called on. \n \nA call like widget.querySelector(\"a\") will thus only find `[a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element)` elements inside of the `widget` element,\n ignoring any other `[a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element)`s that might be scattered throughout the document.\n\n \n 3.4. Relative Selectors[](#relative)\n \nCertain contexts may accept **relative selectors**,\n which are a shorthand for selectors that represent elements relative to one or more **relative selector anchor elements**.\n Relative selectors begin with a [combinator](#selector-combinator),\n with a selector representing the [anchor element](#relative-selector-anchor-elements) implied at the start of the selector.\n (If no combinator is present,\n the [descendant combinator](#descendant-combinator) is implied.)\n\n \nRelative selectors are represented by [<relative-selector>](#typedef-relative-selector) in the selectors [grammar](#grammar),\n and lists of them by [<relative-selector-list>](#typedef-relative-selector-list).\n\n 3.5. Pseudo-classes[](#pseudo-classes)\n \n**Pseudo-classes** are [simple selectors](#simple) that permit selection based on\n information that lies outside of the document tree\n or that can be awkward or impossible to express using the other simple selectors.\n They can also be dynamic,\n in the sense that an element can acquire or lose a pseudo-class\n while a user interacts with the document,\n without the document itself changing. [Pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class) do not appear in or modify the document source or document tree.\n\n \nThe syntax of a [pseudo-class](#pseudo-class) consists of a \":\" (U+003A COLON)\n followed by the name of the pseudo-class as a CSS [identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-css-identifier),\n and, in the case of a **functional pseudo-class**,\n a pair of parentheses containing its arguments.\n\n \n[](#example-86ae2021) For example, [:valid](#valid-pseudo) is a regular pseudo-class,\n and [:lang()](#lang-pseudo) is a [functional pseudo-class](#functional-pseudo-class). \n\n \nLike all CSS keywords, [pseudo-class](#pseudo-class) names are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive).\n No [white space](#whitespace) is allowed between the colon and the name of the pseudo-class,\n nor, as usual for CSS syntax,\n between a [functional pseudo-class](#functional-pseudo-class)’s name and its opening parenthesis\n (which thus form a CSS function token).\n Also as usual, white space is allowed around the arguments inside the parentheses\n of a functional pseudo-class\n unless otherwise specified.\n\n \nLike other [simple selectors](#simple), [pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class) are allowed in all [compound selectors](#compound) contained in a selector,\n and must follow the [type selector](#type-selector) or [universal selector](#universal-selector), if present.\n\n \nNote: Some [pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class) are mutually exclusive\n (such that a [compound selector](#compound) containing them, while valid, will never match anything),\n while others can apply simultaneously to the same element.\n\n 3.6. Pseudo-elements[](#pseudo-elements)\n \n Tests\n \n\n [x-pseudo-element.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/x-pseudo-element.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/x-pseudo-element.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/x-pseudo-element.html)\n \n\n \n \nSimilar to how certain [pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class) represent additional state information\n not directly present in the document tree,\n a **pseudo-element** represents an element not directly present in the document tree.\n They are used to create abstractions about the document tree\n beyond those provided by the document tree.\n For example,\n pseudo-elements can be used to select portions of the document\n that do not correspond to a document-language element\n (including such ranges as don’t align to element boundaries or fit within its tree structure);\n that represent content not in the document tree or in an alternate projection of the document tree;\n or that rely on information provided by styling, layout, user interaction, and other processes that are not reflected in the document tree.\n\n \n [](#example-6916597f) For instance, document languages do not offer mechanisms to access\n the first letter or first line of an element’s content,\n but there exist [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) ([::first-letter](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-letter) and [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line))\n that allow those things to be styled.\n Notice especially that in the case of ::first-line,\n which portion of content is represented by the pseudo-element\n depends on layout information\n that cannot be inferred from the document tree. \n \n[Pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) can also represent content that doesn’t exist in the source document at all,\n such as the [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) and [::after](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-after) pseudo-elements\n which allow additional content to be inserted before or after the contents of any element.\n\n \n \nLike [pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class), [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) do not appear in or modify the document source or document tree.\n Accordingly, they also do not affect the interpretation of [structural pseudo-classes](#structural-pseudo-classes) or other selectors pertaining to their [originating element](#originating-element) or its tree.\n\n \nThe host language defines which pseudo-elements exist, their type, and their abilities.\n Pseudo-elements that exist in CSS\n are defined in [[CSS21]](#biblio-css21) (Level 2), [[SELECT]](#biblio-select) (Level 3), and [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4) (Level 4).\n\n 3.6.1. Syntax[](#pseudo-element-syntax)\n \nThe syntax of a [pseudo-element](#pseudo-element) is \"::\" (two U+003A COLON characters)\n followed by the name of the pseudo-element as an [identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-css-identifier),\n and, in the case of a **functional pseudo-element**,\n a pair of parentheses containing its arguments. Pseudo-element names are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive).\n No [white space](#whitespace) is allowed between the two colons, or between the colons and the name.\n\n \nBecause [CSS Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1) and [CSS Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2) conflated pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes by sharing a single-colon syntax for both,\n user agents must also accept the previous one-colon notation\n for the Level 1 & 2 pseudo-elements\n ([::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before), [::after](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-after), [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line), and [::first-letter](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-letter)).\n This compatibility notation is not allowed for any other [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element).\n However, as this syntax is deprecated,\n authors should use the Level 3+ double-colon syntax for these pseudo-elements.\n\n \n[Pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) are [featureless](#featureless),\n and so can’t be matched by any other selector.\n\n 3.6.2. Binding to the Document Tree[](#pseudo-element-attachment)\n \n[Pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) do not exist independently in the tree:\n they are always bound to another element on the page,\n called their **originating element**.\n Syntactically, a pseudo-element immediately follows\n the [compound selector](#compound) representing its [originating element](#originating-element).\n If this compound selector is omitted,\n it is assumed to be the [universal selector](#universal-selector) [*](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#x).\n\n \n [](#example-e6d9ca44) For example, in the selector div a::before,\n the [a](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#valdef-lab-a) elements matched by the selector are the [originating elements](#originating-element) for the [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) pseudo-elements attached to them. \n \nThe selector [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) is equivalent to *::first-line,\n which selects the ::first-line pseudo-element on every element in the document.\n\n \n \nWhen a [pseudo-element](#pseudo-element) is encountered in a selector,\n the part of the selector before the pseudo-element selects the [originating element](#originating-element) for the pseudo-element;\n the part of the selector after it, if any, applies to the pseudo-element itself.\n (See below.)\n\n 3.6.3. Pseudo-classing Pseudo-elements[](#pseudo-element-states)\n \nCertain [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) may be immediately followed\n by any combination of certain [pseudo-classes](#pseudo-class),\n in which case the pseudo-element is represented only when it is in the corresponding state.\n This specification allows any pseudo-element to be followed\n by any combination of the [logical combination pseudo-classes](#logical-combination-pseudo-classes) and the [user action pseudo-classes](#user-action-pseudo-class).\n Other specifications may allow additional pseudo-classes to be attached to particular pseudo-elements.\n Combinations that are not explicitly allowed are [invalid selectors](#invalid-selector).\n\n \nNote: The [logical combination pseudo-classes](#logical-combination-pseudo-classes) pass any restrictions on validity of selectors at their position\n to their arguments.\n\n \n [](#example-61c8ad8f) For example, since the [:hover](#hover-pseudo) pseudo-class specifies\n that it can apply to any pseudo-element, ::first-line:hover will match when the first line is hovered.\n However, since neither [:focus](#focus-pseudo) nor [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-first-line) define that :focus can apply to ::first-line,\n the selector ::first-line:focus will never match anything. \n \nNotice that ::first-line:hover is very different from :hover::first-line,\n which matches the first line of any originating element that is hovered!\n For example, :hover::first-line also matches the first line of a paragraph\n when the second line of the paragraph is hovered,\n whereas ::first-line:hover only matches if the first line itself is hovered.\n\n \n 3.6.4. Sub-pseudo-elements[](#sub-pseudo-elements)\n \nSome [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) are able to be the [originating element](#originating-element) of other pseudo-elements,\n which are defined as the **sub-pseudo-elements** of this **originating pseudo-element**.\n For example,\n when [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) is given a [list-item](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#valdef-display-list-item) [display type](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#display-type),\n it becomes the [originating pseudo-element](#originating-pseudo-element) of its ::before::marker [sub-pseudo-element](#sub-pseudo-element).\n\n \nWhere disambiguation is needed,\n the term **ultimate originating element** refers to the real (non-pseudo) element\n from which a [pseudo-element](#pseudo-element) originates.\n\n \nUnless the corresponding [sub-pseudo-element](#sub-pseudo-element) is explicitly defined to exist in another specification,\n pseudo-element selectors are not valid\n when compounded to another pseudo-element selector.\n So, for example, ::before::before is an invalid selector,\n but ::before::marker is valid\n (in implementations that support the ::before::marker sub-pseudo-element).\n\n 3.6.5. Internal Structure[](#pseudo-element-structure)\n \nSome [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) are defined to have internal structure.\n These pseudo-elements may be followed by child/descendant combinators\n to express those relationships.\n Selectors containing [combinators](#selector-combinator) after the pseudo-element\n are otherwise invalid.\n\n [](#example-3594b9ac) For example, ::first-letter + span and ::first-letter em are invalid selectors.\n However, if a new ::shadow pseudo-element were defined to have internal structure, ::shadow > p would be a valid selector. \n \nNote: A future specification may expand the capabilities of existing pseudo-elements,\n so some of these currently-invalid selectors (e.g. ::first-line :any-link)\n may become valid in the future.\n\n \nThe children of such [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) can simultaneously be children of other elements, too.\n However, at least in CSS, their rendering must be defined so as to maintain the tree-ness of the [box tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-4/#box-tree).\n\n 3.7.

[[CSS21]](#biblio-css21) Note that escaping a code point “cancels out”\n any special meaning it may have in Selectors.\n For example, the selector #foo>a contains a combinator,\n but #foo\\>a instead selects an element with the id `foo>a`.\n\n 3.8. Declaring Namespace Prefixes[](#namespaces)\n \nCertain selectors support namespace prefixes.\n The mechanism by which namespace prefixes are **declared** should be specified by the language that uses Selectors.\n If the language does not specify a namespace prefix declaration mechanism,\n then no prefixes are declared.\n In CSS, namespace prefixes are declared with the [@namespace](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-namespaces-3/#at-ruledef-namespace) rule.

**:is()**,\n is a functional pseudo-class taking a [<forgiving-selector-list>](#typedef-forgiving-selector-list) as its sole argument.\n\n \nIf the argument, after parsing, is an empty list,\n the pseudo-class is valid but matches nothing.\n Otherwise, the pseudo-class matches any element\n that matches any of the selectors in the list.\n\n \nNote: The specificity of the [:is()](#matches-pseudo) pseudo-class\n is replaced by the specificity of its most specific argument.\n Thus, a selector written with :is() does not necessarily have equivalent specificity\n to the equivalent selector written without :is() For example, if we have :is(ul, ol, .list) > [hidden] and ul > [hidden], ol > [hidden], .list > [hidden] a [hidden] child of an `[ol](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element)` matches the first selector\n with a specificity of (0,2,0)\n whereas it matches the second selector\n with a specificity of (0,1,1).\n See [§ 15 Calculating a selector’s specificity](#specificity-rules).\n\n \nPseudo-elements cannot be represented by the matches-any pseudo-class;\n they are not valid within [:is()](#matches-pseudo).\n\n \nDefault namespace declarations do not affect the [compound selector](#compound) representing the [subject](#selector-subject) of any selector\n within a [:is()](#matches-pseudo) pseudo-class,\n unless that compound selector contains\n an explicit [universal selector](#universal-selector) or [type selector](#type-selector).\n\n \n [](#example-2cab03ed) For example, the following selector matches any element that is being\n hovered or focused, regardless of its namespace. In particular, it\n is not limited to only matching elements in the default namespace\n that are being hovered or focused. \n\n```\n*|*:is(:hover, :focus) \n```\n\n \nThe following selector, however, represents only hovered or focused\n elements that are in the default namespace, because it uses an explicit\n universal selector within the [:is()](#matches-pseudo) notation:\n\n```\n*|*:is(*:hover, *:focus) \n```\n\n \n \nAs previous drafts of this specification\n used the name **:matches()** for this pseudo-class,\n UAs may additionally implement this obsolete name\n as a [legacy selector alias](#legacy-selector-alias) for [:is()](#matches-pseudo) if needed for backwards-compatibility.\n\n 4.3.

[<relative-selector-list>](#typedef-relative-selector-list) as an argument.\n It represents an element if any of the [relative selectors](#relative-selector) would match at least one element\n when [anchored against](#relative-selector-anchor-elements) this element.\n\n \nThe [:has()](#has-pseudo) pseudo-class cannot be nested; :has() is not valid within :has().\n Also, unless explicitly defined as a **:has-allowed pseudo-element**, [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) are not valid selectors within :has().\n (This specification does not define any [:has-allowed pseudo-elements](#has-allowed-pseudo-element),\n but other specifications may do so.)\n\n \nNote: Pseudo-elements are generally excluded from [:has()](#has-pseudo) because\n many of them exist conditionally, based on the styling of their ancestors,\n so allowing these to be queried by :has() would introduce cycles.\n\n \nNote: Since [:has()](#has-pseudo) takes a [<relative-selector-list>](#typedef-relative-selector-list),\n its arguments are inherently [complex selectors](#complex) (because they start, perhaps implicitly, with a combinator).\n This means :has() cannot be used in contexts that don’t allow complex selectors;\n its arguments will be guaranteed to be invalid.\n\n \n [](#example-61d52da1) For example, the following selector matches only `<a>` elements that contain an `<img>` child: \n\n```\na:has(> img)\n```\n\n \nThe following selector matches a `<dt>` element\n immediately followed by another `<dt>` element:\n\n```\ndt:has(+ dt)\n```\n\n \nThe following selector matches `<section>` elements\n that don’t contain any heading elements:\n\n```\nsection:not(:has(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6))\n```\n\n \nNote that ordering matters in the above selector.\n Swapping the nesting of the two pseudo-classes, like:\n\n```\nsection:has(:not(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6))\n```\n\n \n...would result in matching any `<section>` element\n which contains anything that’s not a heading element.",

Universal selector [](#the-universal-selector)\n \n Tests\n \n\n [parse-universal.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/parsing/parse-universal.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/parsing/parse-universal.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/parsing/parse-universal.html)\n \n\n \n \nThe **universal selector** is a special [type selector](#type-selector),\n that represents an element of any element type.\n\n \nIt is written as a [CSS qualified name](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-namespaces-3/#css-qualified-name) with an asterisk (`*` U+002A) as the local name.\n Like a [type selector](#type-selector),\n the [universal selector](#universal-selector) can be qualified by a namespace,\n restricting it to only elements belonging to that namespace,\n and is affected by a default namespace as defined in [§ 5.3 Namespaces in Elemental Selectors](#type-nmsp).\n\n \nUnless an element is [featureless](#featureless),\n the presence of a [universal selector](#universal-selector) has no effect on whether the element matches the selector.\n (Featureless elements do not match any selector,\n including the universal selector.)\n\n \n [](#example-0f5d51ca) \n \n\n *[hreflang|=en] and [hreflang|=en] are equivalent, \n *.warning and .warning are equivalent, \n *#myid and #myid are equivalent. \n \n\n \n \nThe [universal selector](#universal-selector) follows the same syntax rules as other [type selectors](#type-selector):\n only one can appear per [compound selector](#compound),\n and it must be the first [simple selector](#simple) in the compound selector.\n\n \nNote: In some cases, adding a [universal selector](#universal-selector) can make a selector easier to read,\n even though it has no effect on the matching behavior.\n For example, div :first-child and div:first-child are somewhat difficult to tell apart at a quick glance,\n but writing the former as div *:first-child makes the difference obvious.\n\n 5.3. Namespaces in Elemental Selectors[](#type-nmsp)\n \n[Type selectors](#type-selector) and [universal selectors](#universal-selector) allow an optional namespace component:\n a namespace prefix that has been previously [declared](#nsdecl) may be prepended to the element name separated by the namespace separator “vertical bar” (`|` U+007C).\n (See, e.g., [[XML-NAMES]](#biblio-xml-names) for the use of namespaces in XML.)\n It has the following meaning in each form:\n\n \n `ns|E` \n elements with name E in namespace ns \n `*|E` \n elements with name E in any namespace,\n including those without a namespace \n `|E` \n elements with name E without a namespace \n `E` \n if no default namespace has been [declared](#nsdecl) for selectors,\n this is equivalent to *|E.\n Otherwise it is equivalent to ns|E\n where ns is the default namespace. \n \n \n [](#example-53e1ab95) CSS examples: \n\n```\n@namespace foo url(http://www.example.com);\nfoo|h1 { color: blue } /* first rule */\nfoo|* { color: yellow } /* second rule */\n|h1 { color: red } /* ...*/\n*|h1 { color: green }\nh1 { color: green }\n\n```\n\n \nThe first rule (not counting the [@namespace](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-namespaces-3/#at-ruledef-namespace) at-rule)\n will match only [h1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-h1-element) elements in the\n \"http://www.example.com\" namespace.\n\n \nThe second rule will match all elements in the\n \"http://www.example.com\" namespace.\n\n \nThe third rule will match only [h1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-h1-element) elements with\n no namespace.\n\n \nThe fourth rule will match [h1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-h1-element) elements in any\n namespace (including those without any namespace).\n\n \nThe last rule is equivalent to the fourth rule because no default\n namespace has been defined.\n\n \n \nIf a [default namespace](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-namespaces-3/#default-namespace) is declared, [compound selectors](#compound) without [type selectors](#type-selector) in them\n still only match elements in that default namespace.\n\n \n [](#example-03281ceb) For example,\n in the following style sheet: \n\n```\n@namespace url(\"http://example.com/foo\");\n\n.special { ... }\n\n```\n\n \nThe .special selector only matches elements in the \"http://example.com/foo\" namespace,\n even though no reference to the type name (which is paired with the namespace in the DOM) appeared.\n\n \n \nA [type selector](#type-selector) or [universal selector](#universal-selector) containing a namespace prefix\n that has not been previously [declared](#nsdecl) is an [invalid selector](#invalid-selector).\n\n 5.4.

When\n a selector is used as an expression to match against an element,\n an **attribute selector** must be considered to match an element if that\n element has an attribute that matches the attribute represented by the\n attribute selector.\n\n \n[](#issue-745ef775)Add comma-separated syntax for [multiple-value matching](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0215.html)?\n e.g. [rel ~= next, prev, up, first, last] \n\n 6.1. Attribute presence and value selectors[](#attribute-representation)\n \nCSS2 introduced four attribute selectors:\n\n \n [att] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute,\n whatever the value of the attribute. \n [att=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute\n whose value is exactly \"val\". \n [att~=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute\n whose value is a [whitespace](#whitespace)-separated list of words,\n one of which is exactly \"val\".\n If \"val\" contains whitespace,\n it will never represent anything\n (since the words are separated by spaces).\n Also if \"val\" is the empty string,\n it will never represent anything. \n [att|=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute,\n its value either being exactly \"val\"\n or beginning with \"val\" immediately followed by \"-\" (U+002D).\n This is primarily intended to allow language subcode matches\n (e.g., the `hreflang` attribute on the [a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) element in HTML)\n as described in BCP 47 ([[BCP47]](#biblio-bcp47)) or its successor.\n For `lang` (or `xml:lang`) language subcode matching,\n please see the [:lang()](#lang-pseudo) pseudo-class. \n \n \nAttribute values must be [<ident-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-ident-token)s or [<string-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-string-token)s. [[CSS3SYN]](#biblio-css3syn)\n\n \n [](#example-52ee808b) Examples: \n \nThe following attribute selector represents an [h1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-h1-element) element\n that carries the `title` attribute,\n whatever its value:\n\n```\nh1[title]\n```\n\n \nIn the following example, the selector represents a [span](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element) element whose `class` attribute has\n exactly the value \"example\":\n\n```\nspan[class=\"example\"]\n```\n\n \nMultiple attribute selectors can be used to represent several\n attributes of an element, or several conditions on the same\n attribute. Here, the selector represents a [span](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element) element\n whose `hello` attribute has exactly the value \"Cleveland\"\n and whose `goodbye` attribute has exactly the value\n \"Columbus\":\n\n```\nspan[hello=\"Cleveland\"][goodbye=\"Columbus\"]\n```\n\n \nThe following CSS rules illustrate the differences between\n \"=\" and \"~=\". The first selector would match, for example, an [a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) element with the value \"copyright copyleft\n copyeditor\" on a `rel` attribute. The second selector\n would only match an a element with an `href` attribute having the exact value \"http://www.w3.org/\".\n\n```\na[rel~=\"copyright\"] { ... }\na[href=\"http://www.w3.org/\"] { ... }\n\n```\n\n \nThe following selector represents an [a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) element\n whose `hreflang` attribute is exactly \"fr\".\n\n```\na[hreflang=fr] \n```\n\n \nThe following selector represents an [a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) element for\n which the value of the `hreflang` attribute begins with\n \"en\", including \"en\", \"en-US\", and \"en-scouse\":\n\n```\na[hreflang|=\"en\"] \n```\n\n \nThe following selectors represent a DIALOGUE element\n whenever it has one of two different values for an attribute `character`:\n\n```\nDIALOGUE[character=romeo]\nDIALOGUE[character=juliet]\n\n```\n\n \n 6.2. Substring matching attribute selectors[](#attribute-substrings)\n \nThree additional attribute selectors are provided for matching\n substrings in the value of an attribute:\n\n \n [att^=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute\n whose value begins with the prefix \"val\".\n If \"val\" is the empty string\n then the selector does not represent anything. \n [att$=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute\n whose value ends with the suffix \"val\".\n If \"val\" is the empty string\n then the selector does not represent anything. \n [att*=val] \n Represents an element with the `att` attribute\n whose value contains at least one instance of the substring \"val\".\n If \"val\" is the empty string\n then the selector does not represent anything. \n \n \nAttribute values must be [<ident-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-ident-token)s or [<string-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-string-token)s.\n\n \n [](#example-d887e2c3) Examples:\n The following selector represents an HTML [object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-object-element) element,\n referencing an image: \n\n```\nobject[type^=\"image/\"] \n```\n\n \nThe following selector represents an HTML [a](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) element\n with an `href` attribute whose value ends with \".html\".\n\n```\na[href$=\".html\"] \n```\n\n \nThe following selector represents an HTML paragraph\n with a `title` attribute whose value contains the substring \"hello\"\n\n```\np[title*=\"hello\"] \n```\n\n \n 6.3.

Attribute selectors and namespaces[](#attrnmsp)\n \n Tests\n \n\n [selectors-namespace-001.xml](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/selectors-namespace-001.xml) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/selectors-namespace-001.xml) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/selectors-namespace-001.xml)\n \n\n \n \nThe attribute name in an attribute selector is given as a [CSS qualified name](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-namespaces-3/#css-qualified-name): a namespace prefix that has been previously [declared](#nsdecl) may be prepended to the attribute name separated by the namespace\n separator \"vertical bar\" (`|`). In keeping with\n the Namespaces in the XML recommendation, default namespaces do not\n apply to attributes, therefore attribute selectors without a namespace\n component apply only to attributes that have no namespace (equivalent\n to |attr). An asterisk may be used for\n the namespace prefix indicating that the selector is to match all\n attribute names without regard to the attribute’s namespace.\n\n \nAn attribute selector with an attribute name containing a namespace\n prefix that has not been previously [declared](#nsdecl) is\n an invalid selector.\n\n \n [](#example-a7ca2cb1) CSS examples: \n\n```\n@namespace foo \"http://www.example.com\";\n[foo|att=val] { color: blue }\n[*|att] { color: yellow }\n[|att] { color: green }\n[att] { color: green }\n\n```\n\n \nThe first rule will match only elements with the attribute `att` in the \"http://www.example.com\" namespace with the\n value \"val\".\n\n \nThe second rule will match only elements with the attribute `att` regardless of the namespace of the attribute\n (including no namespace).\n\n \nThe last two rules are equivalent and will match only elements\n with the attribute `att` where the attribute is not\n in a namespace.\n\n \n 6.5. Default attribute values in DTDs[](#def-values)\n \nAttribute selectors represent attribute values in the document tree.\n How that document tree is constructed is outside the scope of Selectors.\n In some document formats default attribute values can be defined in a DTD or\n elsewhere, but these can only be selected by attribute selectors if they\n appear in the document tree. Selectors should be designed so that they\n work whether or not the default values are included in the document tree.\n\n \nFor example, a XML UA may, but is not required to,\n read an “external subset” of the DTD, but is required to\n look for default attribute values in the document’s “internal subset”.\n (See, e.g., [[XML10]](#biblio-xml10) for definitions of these subsets.)\n Depending on the UA, a default attribute value defined in the external subset of the DTD\n might or might not appear in the document tree.\n\n \nA UA that recognizes an XML namespace may, but is not required to use its\n knowledge of that namespace to treat default attribute values as if\n they were present in the document. (For example, an XHTML UA is not\n required to use its built-in knowledge of the XHTML DTD. See, e.g., [[XML-NAMES]](#biblio-xml-names) for details on namespaces in XML\n 1.0.)\n\n \nNote: Typically, implementations\n choose to ignore external subsets. This corresponds to the behavior\n of non-validating processors as defined by the XML specification.\n\n \n [](#example-ba3e8ad8) Example: \n \nConsider an element `EXAMPLE` with an attribute `radix` that has a default value of `\"decimal\"`. The DTD fragment might be\n\n```\n<!ATTLIST EXAMPLE radix (decimal,octal) \"decimal\"> \n```\n\n \nIf the style sheet contains the rules\n\n```\nEXAMPLE[radix=decimal] { /*... default property settings ...*/ }\nEXAMPLE[radix=octal] { /*... other settings...*/ }\n\n```\n\n \nthe first rule might not match elements whose `radix` attribute is\n set by default, i.e. not set explicitly. To catch all cases, the\n attribute selector for the default value must be dropped:\n\n```\nEXAMPLE { /*... default property settings ...*/ }\nEXAMPLE[radix=octal] { /*... other settings...*/ }\n\n```\n\n \nHere, because the selector EXAMPLE[radix=octal] is\n more specific than the type selector alone, the style declarations in\n the second rule will override those in the first for elements that\n have a `radix` attribute value of `\"octal\"`. Care has to be taken that\n all property declarations that are to apply only to the default case\n are overridden in the non-default cases' style rules.\n\n \n 6.6. Class selectors[](#class-html)\n \n Tests\n \n\n [parse-class.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/parsing/parse-class.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/parsing/parse-class.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/parsing/parse-class.html)\n [xml-class-selector.xml](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/xml-class-selector.xml) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/xml-class-selector.xml) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/xml-class-selector.xml)\n \n\n \n \nThe **class selector** is given as a full stop (. U+002E) immediately\n followed by an identifier. It represents an element belonging to the\n class identified by the identifier, as defined by the document language.\n For example, in [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5), [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11), and [[MATHML]](#biblio-mathml) membership in a\n class is given by the `class` attribute: in these languages\n it is equivalent to the `~=` notation applied to the\n local `class` attribute\n (i.e. [class~=identifier]).\n\n \n [](#example-f9c08b5b) CSS examples: \n \nWe can assign style information to all elements with `class~=\"pastoral\"` as follows:\n\n```\n*.pastoral { color: green } /* all elements with class~=pastoral */ \n```\n\n \nor just\n\n```\n.pastoral { color: green } /* all elements with class~=pastoral */ \n```\n\n \nThe following assigns style only to H1 elements with `class~=\"pastoral\"`:\n\n```\nH1.pastoral { color: green } /* H1 elements with class~=pastoral */ \n```\n\n \nGiven these rules, the first `H1` instance below would not have\n green text, while the second would:\n\n```\n<H1>Not green</H1>\n<H1 class=\"pastoral\">Very green</H1>\n\n```\n\n \nThe following rule matches any [P](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element) element whose `class` attribute has been assigned a list of [whitespace](#whitespace)-separated values that includes both `pastoral` and `marine`:\n\n```\np.pastoral.marine { color: green } \n```\n\n \nThis rule matches when `class=\"pastoral blue aqua\n marine\"` but does not match for `class=\"pastoral\n blue\"`.\n\n \n \nNote: Because CSS gives considerable\n power to the \"class\" attribute, authors could conceivably design their\n own \"document language\" based on elements with almost no associated\n presentation (such as [div](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element) and [span](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element) in HTML)\n and assigning style\n information through the \"class\" attribute. Authors should avoid this\n practice since the structural elements of a document language often\n have recognized and accepted meanings and author-defined classes may\n not.\n\n \nNote: If an element has multiple\n class attributes, their values must be concatenated with spaces\n between the values before searching for the class. As of this time the\n working group is not aware of any manner in which this situation can\n be reached, however, so this behavior is explicitly non-normative in\n this specification.\n\n \nWhen matching against a document which is in [quirks mode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-quirks),\n class names must be matched [ASCII case-insensitively](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive);\n class selectors are otherwise case-sensitive,\n only matching class names they are [identical to](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-is).

When\n parsing XML, UAs do not always read the DTD, and thus may not know\n what the ID of an element is (though a UA may have namespace-specific\n knowledge that allows it to determine which attribute is the ID\n attribute for that namespace). If a style sheet author knows or\n suspects that a UA may not know what the ID of an element is, they\n should use normal attribute selectors instead: [name=p371] instead of #p371.\n\n \nIf an element has multiple ID attributes, all of them must be\n treated as IDs for that element for the purposes of the ID\n selector. Such a situation could be reached using mixtures of xml:id,\n DOM3 Core, XML DTDs, and namespace-specific knowledge.\n\n \nWhen matching against a document which is in [quirks mode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-quirks),\n IDs must be matched [ASCII case-insensitively](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive);\n ID selectors are otherwise case-sensitive,\n only matching IDs they are [identical to](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-is).

an element based on its directionality\n as determined by the [document language](#document-language).\n For example, [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5) defines [how to determine the directionality of an element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-directionality),\n based on a combination of the `dir` attribute, the surrounding text, and other factors.\n As another example, the `its:dir` and `dirRule` element\n of the Internationalization Tag Set [[ITS20]](#biblio-its20) are able to define the directionality of an element in [[XML10]](#biblio-xml10).\n\n \nThe [:dir()](#dir-pseudo) pseudo-class does not select based on stylistic\n states—for example, the CSS [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction) property does not affect\n whether it matches.\n\n \nThe pseudo-class :dir(ltr) represents an element that\n has a directionality of left-to-right (`ltr`). The\n pseudo-class :dir(rtl) represents an element that has\n a directionality of right-to-left (`rtl`). The argument to [:dir()](#dir-pseudo) must be a single identifier, otherwise the selector\n is invalid. White space is optionally allowed between the identifier\n and the parentheses. Values other than `ltr` and `rtl` are not invalid, but do not match anything. (If a\n future markup spec defines other directionalities, then Selectors may\n be extended to allow corresponding values.)\n\n \nThe difference between :dir(C) and [dir=C] is that [dir=C] only performs a comparison against a given\n attribute on the element, while the :dir(C) pseudo-class\n uses the UAs knowledge of the document’s semantics to perform the\n comparison. For example, in HTML, the directionality of an element\n inherits so that a child without a `dir` attribute will have\n the same directionality as its closest ancestor with a valid `dir` attribute. As another example, in HTML,\n an element that matches [dir=auto] will match either :dir(ltr) or :dir(rtl) depending on the resolved\n directionality of the elements as determined by its contents.

language](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#content-language) of an element is determined,\n it is possible to write selectors that\n represent an element based on its content language.\n The **:lang()** pseudo-class,\n which accepts a comma-separated list of one or more [language ranges](#language-range),\n represents an element whose content language is one of the languages listed in its argument.\n Each **language range** in [:lang()](#lang-pseudo) must be a valid CSS [<ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#typedef-ident) or [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value).\n (Thus language ranges containing asterisks, for example,\n must be either correctly escaped or quoted as strings,\n e.g. :lang(\\*-Latn) or :lang(\"*-Latn\").)\n\n \nNote: The [content language](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#content-language) of an element is defined by the document language.\n\n \nFor example, in HTML [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5), the [content language](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#content-language) is determined\n by a combination of the `lang` attribute,\n information from [meta](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#meta) elements,\n and possibly also the protocol (e.g. from HTTP headers).\n XML languages can use the `xml:lang` attribute\n to indicate language information for an element. [[XML10]](#biblio-xml10)\n\n \nThe element’s [content language](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#content-language) matches a [language range](#language-range) if\n its content language, as represented in BCP 47 syntax,\n matches the given language range in an extended filtering operation per [[RFC4647]](#biblio-rfc4647) Matching of Language Tags (section 3.3.2).\n Both the content language and the language range must be canonicalized and converted to extlang form as per section 4.5 of [[RFC5646]](#biblio-rfc5646) prior to the extended filtering operation.\n The matching is performed case-insensitively within the ASCII range.\n\n \nThe [language range](#language-range) does not need to be a valid language code to\n perform this comparison.\n\n \nFor this purpose, a wildcard [language range](#language-range) (`\"*\"`)\n does not match elements whose language is not tagged (e.g. `lang=\"\"`),\n but does match elements whose language is tagged as undetermined (`lang=und`).\n A language range consisting of an empty string\n (:lang(\"\"))\n matches (only) elements whose language is not tagged.\n\n \nNote: It is recommended that documents and protocols\n indicate language using codes from [[BCP47]](#biblio-bcp47) or its successor,\n and in the case of XML-based formats, by means of `xml:lang` attributes. [[XML10]](#biblio-xml10) See [“FAQ: Two-letter or three-letter language codes.”](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-2or3.html)\n\n \n [](#example-91142d84) Examples:\n The two following selectors represent an HTML document that is in\n Belgian French or German. The two next selectors represent [q](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element) quotations in an arbitrary element in Belgian French\n or German. \n\n```\nhtml:lang(fr-be)\nhtml:lang(de)\n:lang(fr-be) > q\n:lang(de) > q\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: One difference between :lang(C) and the |= operator\n is that the |= operator only performs a comparison against a given\n attribute on the element, while the :lang(C) pseudo-class\n uses the UAs knowledge of the document’s semantics to perform the\n comparison.\n\n \n [](#example-c75c4e33) In this HTML example, only the BODY matches [lang|=fr] (because it has a LANG attribute) but both\n the BODY and the P match :lang(fr) (because both are in\n French). The P does not match the [lang|=fr] because it\n does not have a LANG attribute. \n\n```\n<body lang=fr>\n <p>Je suis français.</p>\n</body>\n\n```\n\n \n \n [](#example-c94037c6) Another difference between :lang(C) and the |= operator\n is that :lang(C) performs implicit wildcard matching. \n \nFor example, :lang(de-DE) will match all of de-DE, de-DE-1996, de-Latn-DE, de-Latf-DE, de-Latn-DE-1996,\n whereas of those [lang|=de-DE] will only match de-DE and de-DE-1996.\n\n \nTo perform wildcard matching on the first subtag (the primary language),\n an asterisk must be used: *-CH will match all of de-CH, it-CH, fr-CH, and rm-CH.\n\n \nTo select against an element’s lang attribute value\n using this type of language range match,\n use both the attribute selector and language pseudo-class together,\n e.g. [lang]:lang(de-DE).\n\n \n \nNote: Wildcard language matching and comma-separated lists are new in Level 4.",

The Target Pseudo-class: [:target](#target-pseudo)[](#the-target-pseudo)\n \nIn some document languages,\n the document’s URL can further point to specific elements within the document\n via the URL’s [fragment](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-fragment).\n The elements pointed to in this way are the target elements of the document.\n\n [](#example-b8c5336f) In HTML the fragment points to the element in the page with the same ID.\n The url `https://example.com/index.html#section2`,\n for example,\n points to the element with `id=\"section2\"` in the document at `https://example.com/index.html`. \n \nThe **:target** pseudo-class matches the document’s target elements.\n If the document’s URL has no fragment identifier, then the document has no target elements.\n\n \n [](#example-8a386e7c) Example: \n\n```\np.note:target \n```\n\n \nThis selector represents a `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` element of class `note` that is the target element of the referring\n URL.\n\n \n \n [](#example-af403697) CSS example:\n Here, the [:target](#target-pseudo) pseudo-class is used to make the\n target element red and place an image before it, if there is one: \n\n```\n:target { color : red }\n:target::before { content : url(target.png) }\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: This specification previously defined a :target-within pseudo-class,\n analogous to [:focus-within](#focus-within-pseudo).\n It was removed in favor of :has(:target),\n which should hopefully suffice to solve the same use-cases.\n\n 8.4.

The Activation Pseudo-class: [:active](#active-pseudo)[](#the-active-pseudo)\n \nThe **:active** pseudo-class\n applies while an element is being “activated” by the user,\n as defined by the host language;\n for example, while a hyperlink is being triggered.\n\n \nIn addition, the [:active](#active-pseudo) pseudo-class applies\n while any generated box of any element (or pseudo-element)\n is being actively indicated by a pointing device (in the “down” state),\n e.g. between the time the user presses the primary mouse button and releases it,\n or while a finger is pressing on a touchscreen.\n\n \nNote: [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5) defines [ specific conditions for HTML elements to be activated ](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#selector-active).\n\n \nAn element also matches [:active](#active-pseudo) if one of its descendants in the [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shadow-1/#flat-tree) (including non-element nodes, such as text nodes)\n matches the above conditions.\n\n 9.3.

matches the currently-focused element,\n UAs only sometimes visibly **indicate focus** (such as by drawing a “focus ring”),\n instead using a variety of heuristics\n to visibly indicate the focus only when it would be most helpful to the user.\n The **:focus-visible** pseudo-class matches a focused element (or pseudo-element)\n in these situations only,\n allowing authors to change the appearance of the focus indicator\n without changing when a focus indicator appears.\n\n \n [](#example-c40d8011) In this example,\n all focusable elements get a strong yellow outline on [:focus-visible](#focus-visible-pseudo),\n and links get both a yellow outline and a yellow background on :focus-visible.\n These styles are consistent throughout the page and are easily visible\n due to their bold styling,\n but do not appear unless the user is likely to need to understand\n where page focus is. \n\n```\n:root {\n --focus-gold: #ffbf47;\n}\n\n:focus-visible {\n outline: 3px solid

focus](#indicate-focus);\n however, the following (non-normative) suggestions can be used as a starting point\n for when to indicate focus on the currently focused element: \n \n\n \n \nIf the user has expressed a preference\n(such as via a system preference or a browser setting)\nto always see a visible focus indicator, [indicate focus](#indicate-focus) regardless of any other factors.\n(Another option may be for the user agent to show its own focus indicator\nregardless of author styles.)\n\n \n \nIf the element which supports keyboard input\n(such as an `[input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element)` element,\nor any other element\nthat would triggers a virtual keyboard to be shown on focus\nif a physical keyboard were not present), [indicate focus](#indicate-focus).\n\n \n \nIf the user interacts with the page via keyboard or some other non-pointing device, [indicate focus](#indicate-focus).\n(This means keyboard usage may change whether this pseudo-class matches\neven if it doesn’t affect [:focus](#focus-pseudo)).\n\n \n \nIf the user interacts with the page via a pointing device (mouse, touchscreen, etc.)\nand the focused element does not support keyboard input,\ndon’t [indicate focus](#indicate-focus).\n\n \n \nIf the previously-focused element [indicated focus](#indicate-focus),\nand a script causes focus to move elsewhere, indicate focus on the newly focused element.\n\n \nConversely, if the previously-focused element did not [indicate focus](#indicate-focus),\nand a script causes focus to move elsewhere,\ndon’t indicate focus on the newly focused element.\n\n \n \nIf a newly-displayed element automatically gains focus\n(such as an action button in a freshly opened dialog),\nthat element should [indicate focus](#indicate-focus).\n\n \n\n \n \nUser agents should also use [:focus-visible](#focus-visible-pseudo) to specify the default focus style,\n so that authors using :focus-visible will not also need to disable\n the default [:focus](#focus-pseudo) style.\n\n 9.5.

The Automatic Input Pseudo-class: [:autofill](#selectordef-autofill)[](#autofill)\n \nThe **:autofill** pseudo-class represents input elements\n that have been automatically filled by the user agent,\n and have not been subsequently altered by the user.\n\n 12.1.5. The Default-option Pseudo-class: [:default](#default-pseudo)[](#the-default-pseudo)\n \nThe **:default** pseudo-class applies to the one or more UI elements\n that are the default among a set of similar elements. Typically applies to\n context menu items, buttons and select lists/menus.\n\n \nOne example is the default submit button among a set of buttons.\n Another example is the default option from a popup menu.\n In a select-many group (such as for pizza toppings), multiple elements can match [:default](#default-pseudo).\n For example, [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5) defines that :default matches [the “default button” in a form,\n the initially-selected `<option>`(s) in a `<select>`,\n and a few other elements.](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#selector-default)\n\n 12.2. Input Value States[](#input-value-states)\n 12.2.1. The Selected-option Pseudo-classes: [:checked](#checked-pseudo), [:unchecked](#unchecked-pseudo), and [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo)[](#checked)\n \nRadio and checkbox elements can be toggled by the user,\n and some menu items are “checked” when the user selects them.\n This state is reflected by the **input value pseudo-classes**.\n\n \nWhen such elements are toggled “on”\n the **:checked** pseudo-class applies.\n For example, [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5) defines that [checked checkboxes, radio buttons, and selected `<option>` elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#selector-checked) match [:checked](#checked-pseudo).\n Similarly, when such elements are toggled “off”,\n the **:unchecked** pseudo-class applies.\n\n \nIf an element that could match [:checked](#checked-pseudo) or [:unchecked](#unchecked-pseudo) is neither \"on\" nor \"off\",\n the **:indeterminate** pseudo-class applies. [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo) also matches elements which do not have a notion of being \"checked\",\n but whose \"value\" is still in an indeterminate state,\n such as a progress meter whose progress percentage is unknown.\n\n \nThese three pseudo-classes are mutually exclusive;\n an element can only match at most one of them at a time.\n (And might match none,\n if the concept of being \"checked\" doesn’t apply to them.)\n If the \"indeterminate\" concept is not mutually exclusive\n with the \"checked\"/\"unchecked\" concept in a host language\n (for example, in HTML a checkbox’s \"indeterminate\" state is a separate boolean\n from its \"checked\" state boolean),\n being indeterminate wins over being checked/unchecked\n for the purpose of matching these pseudo-classes.\n\n \n [](#example-33865490) For example, in HTML: \n \n\n \n \nCheckboxes match [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo) if their [indeterminate](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#dom-input-indeterminate) property is true;\notherwise, they match [:checked](#checked-pseudo) or [:unchecked](#unchecked-pseudo) depending on their [checked](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#dom-input-checked) property.\n\n \n \nRadio buttons match [:checked](#checked-pseudo) if their [checked](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#dom-input-checked) property is true.\nOtherwise, they match [:unchecked](#unchecked-pseudo) if they’re in a radio group\nthat contains a :checked radio button.\nOtherwise (their [checked](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#dom-input-checked) property is false,\nbut they’re alone or in a radio group with no checked radio button),\nthey match [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo).\n\n \n \n`[option](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-option-element)` elements within a `[select](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-select-element)` match [:checked](#checked-pseudo) or [:unchecked](#unchecked-pseudo) depending on their [selected](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#dom-option-selected) property.\n(They’re never [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo).)\n\n \n \n`[progress](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-progress-element)` elements match [:indeterminate](#indeterminate-pseudo) if they lack a `value` attribute\n\n \n\n \n \nWhile the [input value pseudo-classes](#input-value-pseudo-classes) are dynamic in nature,\n and can altered by user action,\n since they can also be based on the presence of semantic attributes in the document\n (such as the `selected` and `checked` attributes in [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5)),\n they apply to all media.\n\n 12.3. Input Value-checking[](#ui-validity)\n 12.3.1. The Validity Pseudo-classes: [:valid](#valid-pseudo) and [:invalid](#invalid-pseudo)[](#validity-pseudos)\n \nAn element is **:valid** or **:invalid** when its contents or value is, respectively,\n valid or invalid with respect to data validity semantics defined by the document language\n (e.g. [[XFORMS11]](#biblio-xforms11) or [[HTML5]](#biblio-html5)).\n An element which lacks data validity semantics is neither [:valid](#valid-pseudo) nor [:invalid](#invalid-pseudo).\n\n \nNote: There is a difference between an element which has no constraints,\n and thus would always be [:valid](#valid-pseudo),\n and one which has no data validity semantics at all,\n and thus is neither :valid nor [:invalid](#invalid-pseudo).\n In HTML, for example, an `<input type=\"text\">` element may have no constraints,\n but a [p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element) element has no validity semantics at all,\n and so it never matches either of these pseudo-classes.\n\n 12.3.2. The Range Pseudo-classes: [:in-range](#in-range-pseudo) and [:out-of-range](#out-of-range-pseudo)[](#range-pseudos)\n \nThe **:in-range** and **:out-of-range** pseudo-classes\n apply only to elements that have range limitations. An element is [:in-range](#in-range-pseudo) or [:out-of-range](#out-of-range-pseudo) when the value\n that the element is bound to is in range or out of range with respect\n to its range limits as defined by the document language. An element\n that lacks data range limits or is not a form control is neither :in-range nor :out-of-range.\n E.g. a slider element with a value of 11 presented as a slider control\n that only represents the values from 1-10 is :out-of-range. Another\n example is a menu element with a value of \"E\" that happens to be\n presented in a popup menu that only has choices \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".\n\n 12.3.3.

[:empty](#empty-pseudo) pseudo-class[](#the-empty-pseudo)\n \n Tests\n \n\n [selectors-empty-001.xml](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/selectors/selectors-empty-001.xml) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/selectors/selectors-empty-001.xml) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/selectors/selectors-empty-001.xml)\n \n\n \n \nThe **:empty** pseudo-class represents\n an element that has no children\n except, optionally, [document white space characters](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#white-space).\n In terms of the document tree,\n only element nodes and content nodes\n (such as [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) text nodes, and entity references)\n whose data has a non-zero length must be considered as affecting emptiness;\n comments, processing instructions, and other nodes\n must not affect whether an element is considered empty or not.\n\n \n [](#example-c085b235) Examples: p:empty is a valid representation of the `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` elements\n in the following HTML fragment: \n\n```\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <!-- comment --></p>\n\n```\n\n \ndiv:empty is not a valid representation of the `<div>` elements\n in the following fragment:\n\n```\n<div>text</div>\n<div><p></p></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><p>bla</p></div>\n<div>this is not <p>:empty</p></div>\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: In Level 2 and Level 3 of Selectors, [:empty](#empty-pseudo) did not match elements that contained only white space.\n This was changed so that that—​given white space is largely collapsible in HTML\n and is therefore used for source code formatting,\n and especially because elements with omitted end tags\n are likely to absorb such white space into their DOM text contents—​elements which authors perceive of as empty\n can be selected by this selector, as they expect.\n\n 13.3.

Note the whitespace on\n either side of the \"*\" is not part of the universal selector; the\n whitespace is a combinator indicating that the `div` must be the\n ancestor of some element, and that that element must be an ancestor\n of the `p`.\n The following selector, which combines descendant combinators and [attribute selectors](#attribute-selectors), represents an\n element that (1) has the `href` attribute set and (2) is\n inside a `p` that is itself inside a `div`:\n\n```\ndiv p *[href]\n```\n\n \n 14.2.

Parse A Selector[](#parse-selector)\n \nThis section defines how to **parse a selector** from a string source.\n It returns either a complex selector list,\n or failure.\n\n \n\n Let selector be the result of [parsing](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#css-parse-something-according-to-a-css-grammar) source as a [<selector-list>](#typedef-selector-list).\n If this returns failure,\n it’s an [invalid selector](#invalid-selector);\n return failure. \n If selector is an [invalid selector](#invalid-selector) for any other reason\n (such as, for example, containing an undeclared namespace prefix),\n return failure. \n Otherwise,\n return selector. \n \n\n 17.2.

Match a Selector Against a Tree[](#match-against-tree)\n \nThis section defines how to **match a selector against a tree**.\n\n \nAPIs using this algorithm must provide a selector,\n and one or more root elements indicating the [subtrees](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree) that will be searched by the selector.\n All of the root elements must share the same [root](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-root),\n or else calling this algorithm is invalid.\n\n \nThey may optionally provide:\n\n \n\n One or more [scoping roots](#scoping-root) indicating the selector is [scoped](#scoped-selector). \n \n A list of [pseudo-elements](#pseudo-element) that are allowed to show up in the match list.\n If not specified, this defaults to allowing all pseudo-elements. \n \n[](#issue-15f3317f) Only the [tree-abiding pseudo-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#tree-abiding) are really\n handled in any way remotely like this.\n\n \n\n \nThis algorithm returns a (possibly empty) list of elements.\n\n \n\n Start with a list of candidate elements,\n which are the root elements and all of their descendant elements,\n sorted in [shadow-including tree order](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-tree-order),\n unless otherwise specified. \n If [scoping root](#scoping-root) were provided,\n then remove from the candidate elements any elements that are not [descendants](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-descendant) of at least one scoping root. \n Initialize the selector match list to empty. \n \n For each element in the set of candidate elements: \n \n\n If the result of [match a selector against an element](#match-a-selector-against-an-element) for element and selector is success,\n add element to the selector match list. \n \n For each possible pseudo-element associated with element that is one of the pseudo-elements allowed to show up in the match list,\n if the result of [match a selector against a pseudo-element](#match-a-selector-against-a-pseudo-element) for the pseudo-element and selector is success,\n add the pseudo-element to the selector match list. \n \n[](#issue-b7f52036) The relative position of pseudo-elements\n in selector match list is undefined.\n There’s not yet a context that exposes this information,\n but we need to decide on something eventually,\n before something is exposed.",

Do this only\nfor navigations from top-level frames or iframes which are\nsame-origin with their top-level frame.\n\n \nNote: This allows for a site to see [:visited](#visited-pseudo) information about its own pages\n(which is already observable by the site)\nregardless of what site initiated the navigation to that page.\nIn other words, any `A -> B` navigation\nwhere the site is B.\n\n \nNote: Notably, direct navigations triggered by the user agent’s UI,\nsuch as typing into the address bar,\nclicking on bookmarks,\nor dragging a link from another program into the page, do not add a visited history entry.\nThese can, of course,\nstill add to the browser’s record of visited sites\nthat it uses for other purposes,\nsuch as suggesting URLs as the user types into the URL bar.\n\n \n \nWhen determining if a link element should match [:link](#link-pseudo) or [:visited](#visited-pseudo),\nonly allow it to match :visited if\nthe link’s destination,\nthe origin of the page containing the link,\nand the top-level site containing the link\nmatch a tuple in visited history.\n\n \n\n \n The inclusion of both page origin and top-level site\n prevents several possible privacy attacks,\n such as: \n \n\n \n \nIf history entries were only keyed by the starting site’s URL,\na tracking site could be embedded in a hidden iframe on multiple sites\nwhich triggers a navigation to a unique URL for a user on the first visit,\nand then uses many such links on subsequent visits\nto see which one had been visited,\neffectively becoming a new \"third-party cookie\"\nidentifying the user across the web.\nBy keying the history entry with the top-level site,\nthis information can’t be shared across different sites.\n\n \n \nIf history entires were only keyed by the top-level site’s URL,\na hostile iframe,\nperhaps included in a page as part of an advertisement,\ncould observe what sites were visited from the top-level site.\nBy keying the history entry with the link’s own site,\nthe top-level site’s information can’t \"leak\" into cross-origin iframes.",
