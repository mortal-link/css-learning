This allows UAs to parse (though not completely\nunderstand) style sheets written in levels of CSS that did not exist at\nthe time the UAs were created. Designers can use this feature to\ncreate style sheets that work with older user agents, while also\nexercising the possibilities of the latest levels of CSS.\n\nAt the lexical level, CSS style sheets consist of a sequence of tokens.\nThe list of tokens for CSS is as follows. The definitions use Lex-style\nregular expressions. Octal codes refer to ISO 10646 ([[ISO10646]](refs.html#ref-ISO10646)).

The sections that follow describe\nhow to use it. [Appendix G](grammar.html) describes a\nmore restrictive grammar that is closer to the CSS level 2 language.\nParts of style sheets that can be parsed according to this grammar but\nnot according to the grammar in Appendix G are among the parts that\nwill be ignored according to the [rules for\nhandling parsing errors](#parsing-errors).\n\n```\n\nstylesheet : [ CDO | CDC | S | statement ]*;\nstatement : ruleset | at-rule;\nat-rule : ATKEYWORD S* any* [ block | ';' S* ];\nblock : '{' S* [ any | block | ATKEYWORD S* | ';' S* ]* '}' S*;\nruleset : selector?

It is included here only to help with error\nhandling. (See [4.2 \"Rules for handling\nparsing errors.\"](#parsing-errors))\n\nCOMMENT tokens do not occur\nin the grammar (to keep it readable), but any number of these tokens\nmay appear anywhere outside other tokens. (Note, however, that a\ncomment before or within the @charset rule disables the @charset.)\n\nThe token S in the grammar above stands for white space. Only the characters \"space\" (U+0020), \"tab\" (U+0009), \"line feed\" (U+000A), \"carriage return\" (U+000D), and\n\"form feed\" (U+000C) can occur in white space. Other space-like characters,\nsuch as \"em-space\" (U+2003) and \"ideographic space\" (U+3000), are never part of white space.\n\nThe meaning of input that cannot be tokenized or parsed is\nundefined in CSS 2.2.",

Keywords\nand [property names](#properties) beginning\nwith -' or '_' are reserved for vendor-specific extensions. Such vendor-specific extensions should have one of the following formats:\n\n```\n\n'-' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name\n'_' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name\n\n```\n\nExample(s):\n\nFor example, if XYZ organization added a property to describe the color of the\nborder on the East side of the display, they might call it -xyz-border-east-color.\n\nOther known examples:\n\n```\n\n-moz-box-sizing\n-moz-border-radius\n-wap-accesskey\n\n```\n\nAn initial dash or underscore is guaranteed never to be used in a property or keyword by any current or future level of CSS. Thus typical CSS implementations may not\nrecognize such properties and may ignore them according to the [rules for handling parsing errors](#parsing-errors). However, because the initial dash or underscore is part of the grammar, CSS 2.2 implementers should always be able to use a CSS-conforming parser, whether or not they support any vendor-specific extensions.\n\nAuthors should avoid vendor-specific extensions\n\n4.1.2.2 Informative Historical Notes\n\nThis section is informative.\n\nAt the time of writing, the following prefixes are known to exist:\n\nprefixorganization\n\n`-ms-`, `mso-`Microsoft\n`-moz-`Mozilla\n`-o-`, `-xv-`Opera Software\n`-atsc-`Advanced Television Standards Committee\n`-wap-`The WAP Forum\n`-khtml-`KDE\n`-webkit-`Apple\n`prince-`YesLogic\n`-ah-`Antenna House\n`-hp-`Hewlett Packard\n`-ro-`Real Objects\n`-rim-`Research In Motion\n`-tc-`TallComponents",

      "content": "The following rules always hold:\n\n - All CSS syntax is case-insensitive within the ASCII\n range (i.e., [a-z] and [A-Z] are equivalent), except for parts that are\n not under the control of CSS. For example, the case-sensitivity of\n values of the HTML attributes \"id\" and \"class\", of font names, and\n of URIs lies outside the scope of this specification. Note in\n particular that element names are case-insensitive in HTML, but\n case-sensitive in XML.\n \n\n - In CSS, **identifiers**\n (including element names, classes, and IDs in [selectors](selector.html)) can contain only the\n characters [a-zA-Z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters U+0080 and higher,\n plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore (_); they cannot start with\n a digit, two hyphens, or a hyphen followed by a digit.\n Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646\n character as a numeric code (see next item).\n For instance, the identifier \"B&W?\" may\n be written as \"B\\&W\\?\" or \"B\\26 W\\3F\".\n \nNote that Unicode is code-by-code equivalent to ISO 10646 (see\n [[UNICODE]](refs.html#ref-UNICODE) and [[ISO10646]](refs.html#ref-ISO10646)).\n \n\n \n\n - In CSS 2.2, a backslash (\\) character can indicate one\n of three types of character\n escape. Inside a CSS comment, a backslash stands for\n itself, and if a backslash is immediately followed by the end of\n the style sheet, it also stands for itself (i.e., a DELIM token).\n\n \nFirst, inside a [string](#strings), a backslash\n followed by a newline is ignored (i.e., the string is deemed not\n to contain either the backslash or the newline).\n Outside a string, a backslash followed by a newline stands for\n itself (i.e., a DELIM followed by a newline).\n\n Second, it cancels the meaning of special CSS characters.\n Any character (except a\n hexadecimal digit, linefeed, carriage return, or form feed)\n can be escaped\n with a backslash to remove its special meaning.\n For example, \"\\\"\" is a string consisting of one\n double quote. Style sheet preprocessors must not remove\n these backslashes from a style sheet since that would\n change the style sheet's meaning.\n \n\n \nThird, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters\n they cannot easily put in a document. In this case, the backslash\n is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which\n stand for the ISO 10646 ([[ISO10646]](refs.html#ref-ISO10646)) \n character with that number, which must not be zero. \n (It is undefined in CSS 2.2 what happens if a style sheet\n does contain a character with Unicode codepoint zero.)\n If a character in the range [0-9a-fA-F] follows the hexadecimal number,\n the end of the number needs to be made clear. There are two ways\n to do that:\n \n\n \n\n with a space (or other white space character): \"\\26 B\" (\"&B\").\n In this case, user agents should treat a \"CR/LF\" pair \n (U+000D/U+000A) as a single white space character.\n\n - by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits: \"\\000026B\" (\"&B\")\n\n \n\n \nIn fact, these two methods may be combined. Only one white space\n character is ignored after a hexadecimal escape. Note that this means\n that a \"real\" space after the escape sequence must be\n doubled.\n \n\n If the number is outside the range allowed by Unicode (e.g.,\n \"\\110000\" is above the maximum 10FFFF allowed in current Unicode),\n the UA may replace the escape with the \"replacement character\"\n (U+FFFD). If the character is to be displayed, the UA should show\n a visible symbol, such as a \"missing character\" glyph (cf. [15.2,](fonts.html#algorithm) point 5).\n \n - Note: Backslash escapes are always\n considered to be part of an [identifier](#value-def-identifier) or a string (i.e.,\n \"\\7B\" is not punctuation, even though \"{\" is, and \"\\32\" is allowed\n at the start of a class name, even though \"2\" is not).\n\n The identifier \"te\\st\" is exactly the same identifier as \"test\".",

      "heading": "4.2 Rules for handling parsing errors",
      "content": "In some cases, user agents must ignore part of an illegal style\nsheet. This specification defines **ignore** to mean\nthat the user agent parses the illegal part (in order to find its\nbeginning and end), but otherwise acts as if it had not been there. \nCSS 2.2 reserves for future updates of CSS all property:value combinations \nand @-keywords that do not contain an identifier beginning with dash or \nunderscore. Implementations must ignore such combinations (other than those \nintroduced by future updates of CSS).\n\nTo ensure that new properties and new values for existing\nproperties can be added in the future, user agents are required to\nobey the following rules when they encounter the following\nscenarios:\n\n- Unknown properties. User agents must [ignore](#ignore) a [declaration](syndata.html#declaration) with an unknown\nproperty. For example, if the style sheet is:\n\n```\n\nh1 { color: red; rotation: 70minutes }\n\n```\n\n the user agent will treat this as if the style sheet had been\n\n```\n\nh1 { color: red }\n\n```\n\n- Illegal values. User agents must ignore a\ndeclaration with an illegal value. For example:\n\n```\n\nimg { float: left } /* correct CSS 2.2 */\nimg { float: left here } /* \"here\" is not a value of 'float' */\nimg { background: \"red\" } /* keywords cannot be quoted */\nimg { border-width: 3 } /* a unit must be specified for length values */\n\n```\n\nA CSS 2.2 parser would honor the first rule and\n[ignore](#ignore)\nthe rest, as if the style sheet had been:\n\n```\n\nimg { float: left }\nimg { }\nimg { }\nimg { }\n\n```\n\nA user agent conforming to a future CSS specification may accept one or\nmore of the other rules as well.\n\n- Malformed declarations. User agents must handle\nunexpected tokens encountered while parsing a declaration by reading\nuntil the end of the declaration, while observing the rules for matching\npairs of (), [], {}, \"\", and '', and correctly handling escapes. For\nexample, a malformed declaration may be missing a property name, colon (:), or\nproperty value.\n\nWhen the UA expects the start of a declaration or at-rule (i.e., an\nIDENT token or an ATKEYWORD token) but finds an unexpected token\ninstead, that token is considered to be the first token of a malformed\ndeclaration. I.e., the rule for malformed declarations, rather than\nmalformed statements is used to determine which tokens to ignore in\nthat case.\n\nThe following are all equivalent:\n\n```\n\np { color:green }\np { @foo { bar: baz } color:green } /* unknown at-rule */\np { color:green; color } /* malformed declaration missing ':', value */\np { color:red; color; color:green } /* same with expected recovery */\np { color:green; color: } /* malformed declaration missing value */\np { color:red; color:; color:green } /* same with expected recovery */\np { color:green; color{;color:maroon} } /* unexpected tokens { } */\np { color:red; color{;color:maroon}; color:green } /* same with recovery */\n\n```\n\n- Malformed statements. User agents must handle\nunexpected tokens encountered while parsing a statement by reading\nuntil the end of the statement, while observing the rules for matching\npairs of (), [], {}, \"\", and '', and correctly handling escapes. For\nexample, a malformed statement may contain an unexpected closing brace\nor at-keyword. E.g., the following lines are all ignored:\n\n```\n\np @here {color: red} /* ruleset with unexpected at-keyword \"@here\" */\n@foo @bar; /* at-rule with unexpected at-keyword \"@bar\" */\n}} {{ - }} /* ruleset with unexpected right brace */\n) ( {} ) p {color: red } /* ruleset with unexpected right parenthesis */\n\n```\n\nAt-rules with unknown at-keywords. User agents must [ignore](#ignore)\nan invalid at-keyword together with everything following it, up to the\nend of the block that contains the invalid at-keyword, or up to and\nincluding the next semicolon (;), or up to and including the next\nblock ({...}), whichever comes first.

Therefore, the whole\nat-rule (up to, and including, the third right curly brace) is [ignored.](#ignore) A\nCSS 2.2 user agent [ignores](#ignore) it, effectively reducing the style sheet\nto:\n\n```\n\nh1 { color: blue }\n\n```\n\nSomething inside an at-rule that is ignored because it is invalid,\nsuch as an invalid declaration within an @media-rule, does not make\nthe entire at-rule invalid.\n\n- Unexpected end of style sheet.\n\nUser agents must close all open constructs (for example: blocks, parentheses, brackets, rules, strings, and comments) at the end of the\nstyle sheet. For example:\n\n```\n\n @media screen {\n p:before { content: 'Hello\n\n```\n\nwould be treated the same as:\n\n```\n\n @media screen {\n p:before { content: 'Hello'; }\n }\n\n```\n\nin a conformant UA.\n\n- Unexpected end of string.\n\n User agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line\n (i.e., before an unescaped line feed, carriage return or form\n feed character), but\n then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string\n was found. For example:\n\n```\n\n p {\n color: green;\n font-family: 'Courier New Times\n color: red;\n color: green;\n }\n\n```\n\n ...would be treated the same as:\n\n```\n\n p { color: green; color: green; }\n\n```\n\n ...because the second declaration (from 'font-family' to the\n semicolon after 'color: red') is invalid and is dropped.\n\n- See also [Rule sets, declaration blocks, and\nselectors](#rule-sets) for parsing rules for declaration blocks.",

After a zero length, the unit identifier is optional.\n\n Some properties allow negative length values, but this may\ncomplicate the formatting model and there may be\nimplementation-specific limits. If a negative length value cannot be\nsupported, it should be converted to the nearest value that can be\nsupported.\n\nIf a negative length value is set on a property that does not allow\n negative length values, the declaration is ignored.\n\nIn cases where the [used](cascade.html#usedValue)\nlength cannot be supported, user agents must approximate it in the\n[actual value.](cascade.html#actual-value)\n\nThere are two types of length units:\nrelative and absolute. Relative length units specify a length relative\n\nto another length property. Style sheets that use relative units\ncan more easily scale from one output environment\nto another.\n\nRelative units are:\n\n- em: the ['font-size'](fonts.html#propdef-font-size) of the relevant font\n\n- ex: the 'x-height' of the relevant font\n\nExample(s):\n\n```\n\nh1 { margin: 0.5em } /* em */\nh1 { margin: 1ex } /* ex */\n\n```\n\nThe 'em' unit is equal to the computed value of\nthe ['font-size'](fonts.html#propdef-font-size) property of\nthe element on which it is used. The exception is when 'em' occurs in\nthe value of the 'font-size' property itself, in which case it refers\nto the font size of the parent element. It may be used for vertical or\nhorizontal measurement. (This unit is also sometimes called the\nquad-width in typographic texts.)\n\nThe 'ex' unit is defined by the element's first available\nfont.\nThe exception is when 'ex' occurs in the value of the ['font-size'](fonts.html#propdef-font-size) property, in which case\nit refers to the 'ex' of the parent element.\n\nThe 'x-height' is so called\nbecause it is often equal to the height of the lowercase \"x\". However,\nan 'ex' is defined even for fonts that do not contain an \"x\".\n\nThe x-height of a font can be found in different ways. Some fonts\ncontain reliable metrics for the x-height. If reliable font metrics are\nnot available, UAs may determine the x-height from the height of a\nlowercase glyph. One possible heuristic is to look at how far the glyph\nfor the lowercase \"o\" extends below the baseline, and subtract that value\nfrom the top of its bounding box. In the cases where it is impossible or\nimpractical to determine the x-height, a value of 0.5em should be used.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe rule:\n\n```\n\nh1 { line-height: 1.2em }\n\n```\n\nmeans that the line height of \"h1\" elements will be 20% greater\nthan the font size of the \"h1\" elements. On the other hand:\n\n```\n\nh1 { font-size: 1.2em }\n\n```\n\nmeans that the font-size of \"h1\" elements will be 20% greater than\nthe font size inherited by \"h1\" elements.\n\nWhen specified for the root of the [\ndocument tree](conform.html#doctree) (e.g., \"HTML\" in HTML), 'em' and 'ex' refer to\nthe property's [initial value](about.html#initial-value).\n\nChild elements do not inherit the relative values specified for\ntheir parent; they inherit the [computed values](cascade.html#computed-value).\n\nExample(s):\n\n \nIn the following rules, the computed ['text-indent'](text.html#propdef-text-indent) value of \"h1\" elements\nwill be 36px, not 45px, if \"h1\" is a child of the \"body\" element.\n\n```\n\nbody {\n font-size: 12px;\n text-indent: 3em; /* i.e., 36px */\n}\nh1 { font-size: 15px }\n\n```\n\n Absolute\n\nlength\n\nunits are fixed in relation to each other.\nThey are mainly useful\nwhen the output\nenvironment is known. The absolute units consist of the physical units\n(in, cm, mm, pt, pc) and the px unit:\n\n- in: inches — 1in is equal\n to 2.54cm.\n\n- cm: centimeters\n\n- mm: millimeters\n\n- pt: points — the points used by CSS are equal to\n 1/72nd of 1in. \n\n- pc: picas — 1pc is equal\n to 12pt.\n\n- px: pixel units — 1px is equal to 0.75pt.\n\nFor a CSS device, these dimensions are either anchored (i) by\nrelating the physical units to their physical measurements, or\n(ii) by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel.\nFor print media and similar high-resolution devices, the anchor unit\nshould be one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc).\nFor lower-resolution devices, and devices with unusual viewing distances,\nit is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the pixel unit. For\nsuch devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole\nnumber of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel.\n\nNote that if the anchor unit is the pixel unit,\nthe physical units might not match their physical measurements.\nAlternatively if the anchor unit is a physical unit, the pixel\nunit might not map to a whole number of device pixels.\n\nNote that this definition of the pixel unit and\nthe physical units differs from previous versions of CSS. In\nparticular, in previous versions of CSS the pixel unit and the\nphysical units were not related by a fixed ratio: the physical\nunits were always tied to their physical measurements while the\npixel unit would vary to most closely match the reference pixel.\n(This change was made because too much existing content relies\non the assumption of 96dpi, and breaking that assumption breaks\nthe content.)\n\nThe reference pixel is the\nvisual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi\nand a distance from the reader of an arm's length. For a nominal arm's\nlength of 28 inches, the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213\ndegrees. For reading at arm's length, 1px thus corresponds to about\n0.26 mm (1/96 inch).\n\nThe image below illustrates the effect of viewing distance on\nthe size of a reference pixel: a reading distance of 71 cm\n(28 inches) results in a reference pixel of 0.26 mm,\nwhile a reading distance of 3.5 m (12 feet) results in\na reference pixel of 1.3 mm.\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/pixel1-desc.html)\n\nThis second image illustrates the effect of a device's resolution\non the pixel unit: an area of 1px by 1px is covered by a single dot\nin a low-resolution device (e.g. a typical computer display), while\nthe same area is covered by 16 dots in a higher resolution device\n(such as a printer).\n\n [[D]](images/longdesc/pixel2-desc.html)\n\nExample(s):\n\n```\n\nh1 { margin: 0.5in } /* inches */\nh2 { line-height: 3cm } /* centimeters */\nh3 { word-spacing: 4mm } /* millimeters */\nh4 { font-size: 12pt } /* points */\nh4 { font-size: 1pc } /* picas */\np { font-size: 12px } /* px */\n\n```",

The three-digit RGB notation (#rgb) is converted into\nsix-digit form (#rrggbb) by replicating digits, not by adding\nzeros. For example, #fb0 expands to #ffbb00. This ensures that\nwhite (#ffffff) can be specified with the short notation (#fff) and\nremoves any dependencies on the color depth of the display.\n\n The format of an RGB value in the functional notation is 'rgb('\nfollowed by a comma-separated list of three numerical values (either\nthree integer values or three percentage values) followed by ')'.\nThe integer value 255 corresponds to 100%, and to F or FF in the\nhexadecimal notation: rgb(255,255,255) = rgb(100%,100%,100%) =\n#FFF. [White space](#whitespace) characters are allowed\naround the numerical values.\n\nAll RGB colors are specified in the sRGB color space (see\n[[SRGB]](refs.html#ref-SRGB)). User agents may vary in the fidelity with which they\nrepresent these colors, but using sRGB provides an unambiguous and\nobjectively measurable definition of what the color should be, which\ncan be related to international standards (see [[COLORIMETRY]](refs.html#ref-COLORIMETRY)).\n\n[Conforming user agents](conform.html#conformance) may\nlimit their color-displaying efforts to performing a gamma-correction\non them. sRGB specifies a display gamma of 2.2 under specified viewing\nconditions. User agents should adjust the colors given in CSS such that,\nin combination with an output device's \"natural\" display gamma, an\neffective display gamma of 2.2 is produced. Note that only colors specified in CSS are affected; e.g.,\nimages are expected to carry their own color information.\n\nValues outside the device gamut should be clipped or\nmapped into the gamut when the gamut is known: the red, green,\nand blue values must be changed to fall within the range supported by\nthe device. Users agents may perform higher quality mapping of colors\nfrom one gamut to another. For a typical CRT monitor, whose device\ngamut is the same as sRGB, the four rules below are equivalent:\n\nExample(s):\n\n```\n\nem { color: rgb(255,0,0) } /* integer range 0 - 255 */\nem { color: rgb(300,0,0) } /* clipped to rgb(255,0,0) */\nem { color: rgb(255,-10,0) } /* clipped to rgb(255,0,0) */\nem { color: rgb(110%, 0%, 0%) } /* clipped to rgb(100%,0%,0%) */\n\n```\n\nOther devices, such as printers, have different gamuts than sRGB;\nsome colors outside the 0..255 sRGB range will be representable\n(inside the device gamut), while other colors inside the 0..255 sRGB\nrange will be outside the device gamut and will thus be mapped.\n\nNote. Mapping or clipping of\ncolor values should be done to the actual device gamut if known (which\nmay be larger or smaller than 0..255).",

For a good introduction to character sets\nand character encodings, please consult the HTML 4\nspecification ([[HTML4]](refs.html#ref-HTML4), chapter 5). See also the XML 1.1\nspecification ([[XML11]](refs.html#ref-XML11), sections 2.2 and 4.3.3, and Appendix E).\n\nWhen a style sheet is embedded in another document, such as in the\nSTYLE element or \"style\" attribute of HTML, the style sheet shares the\ncharacter encoding of the whole document.\n\nWhen a style sheet resides in a separate file, user agents must\nobserve the following priorities when\ndetermining a style sheet's character\nencoding (from highest priority to lowest):\n\n- An HTTP \"charset\" parameter in a \"Content-Type\" field\n(or similar parameters in other protocols)\n\n- BOM and/or @charset (see below)\n\n- `<link charset=\"\">` or other metadata from the linking mechanism (if any)\n\n- charset of referring style sheet or document (if any)\n\n- Assume UTF-8\n\nAuthors using an @charset rule must\nplace the rule at the very beginning of the style sheet, preceded by\nno characters. (If a byte order mark is appropriate for the encoding\nused, it may precede the @charset rule.)\n\nAfter \"@charset\", authors specify\nthe name of a character encoding (in quotes). For example:\n\n```\n@charset \"ISO-8859-1\";\n```\n\n@charset must be written literally, i.e., the 10 characters\n'@charset \"' (lowercase, no backslash escapes), followed by the\nencoding name, followed by '\";'.\n\nThe name must be a charset name as described in the IANA registry.\nSee [[CHARSETS]](refs.html#ref-CHARSETS) for a complete list of charsets. Authors should use\nthe charset names marked as \"preferred MIME name\" in the IANA\nregistry.\n\nUser agents must support at least the UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIf rule 1 above (an HTTP \"charset\" parameter or similar) yields a\ncharacter encoding and it is one of UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32, then a\nBOM, if any, at the start of the file overrides that character\nencoding, as follows:\n\nFirst bytes (hexadecimal) Resulting encoding\n\n00 00 FE FF UTF-32, big-endian\nFF FE 00 00 UTF-32, little-endian\nFE FF UTF-16, big-endian\nFF FE UTF-16, little-endian\nEF BB BF UTF-8\n\nIf rule 1 yields a character encoding of UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE,\nUTF-32BE or UTF-32LE, then it is an error if the file starts with a\nBOM. A CSS UA must recover by ignoring the specified encoding and\nusing the table above.\n\nNote that the fact that a BOM at the start of a file is\nen error in UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE is specified by\n[[UNICODE]](refs.html#ref-UNICODE).\n\nUser agents must ignore any @charset rule not at the beginning of the\nstyle sheet. When user agents detect the character encoding using the\nBOM and/or the @charset rule, they should follow the following rules:\n\n- Except as specified in these rules, all @charset rules are ignored.\n\n- The encoding is detected based on the stream of bytes that begins\nthe style sheet. The following table gives a set of possibilities for\ninitial byte sequences (written in hexadecimal). The first row that\nmatches the beginning of the style sheet gives the result of encoding\ndetection based on the BOM and/or @charset rule. If no rows match, the\nencoding cannot be detected based on the BOM and/or @charset rule. The\nnotation (...)* refers to repetition for which the best match is the one\nthat repeats as few times as possible. The bytes marked \"XX\" are those\nused to determine the name of the encoding, by treating them, in the\norder given, as a sequence of ASCII characters. Bytes marked \"YY\" are\nsimilar, but need to be transcoded into ASCII as noted. User agents may\nignore entries in the table if they do not support any encodings\nrelevant to the entry.\n\nInitial BytesResult\nEF BB BF 40 63 68 61 72 73 65 74 20 22 (XX)* 22 3Bas specified\nEF BB BFUTF-8\n40 63 68 61 72 73 65 74 20 22 (XX)* 22 3Bas specified\nFE FF 00 40 00 63 00 68 00 61 00 72 00 73 00 65 00 74 00 20 00 22 (00 XX)* 00 22 00 3Bas specified (with BE endianness if not specified)\n00 40 00 63 00 68 00 61 00 72 00 73 00 65 00 74 00 20 00 22 (00 XX)* 00 22 00 3Bas specified (with BE endianness if not specified)\nFF FE 40 00 63 00 68 00 61 00 72 00 73 00 65 00 74 00 20 00 22 00 (XX 00)* 22 00 3B 00as specified (with LE endianness if not specified)\n40 00 63 00 68 00 61 00 72 00 73 00 65 00 74 00 20 00 22 00 (XX 00)* 22 00 3B 00as specified (with LE endianness if not specified)\n00 00 FE FF 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 (00 00 00 XX)* 00 00 00 22 00 00 00 3Bas specified (with BE endianness if not specified)\n00 00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 (00 00 00 XX)* 00 00 00 22 00 00 00 3Bas specified (with BE endianness if not specified)\n00 00 FF FE 00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 (00 00 XX 00)* 00 00 22 00 00 00 3B 00as specified (with 2143 endianness if not specified)\n00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 (00 00 XX 00)* 00 00 22 00 00 00 3B 00as specified (with 2143 endianness if not specified)\nFE FF 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 00 (00 XX 00 00)* 00 22 00 00 00 3B 00 00as specified (with 3412 endianness if not specified)\n00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 00 (00 XX 00 00)* 00 22 00 00 00 3B 00 00as specified (with 3412 endianness if not specified)\nFF FE 00 00 40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 00 00 (XX 00 00 00)* 22 00 00 00 3B 00 00 00as specified (with LE endianness if not specified)\n40 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 72 00 00 00 73 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 22 00 00 00 (XX 00 00 00)* 22 00 00 00 3B 00 00 00as specified (with LE endianness if not specified)\n00 00 FE FFUTF-32-BE\nFF FE 00 00UTF-32-LE\n00 00 FF FEUTF-32-2143\nFE FF 00 00UTF-32-3412\nFE FFUTF-16-BE\nFF FEUTF-16-LE\n7C 83 88 81 99 A2 85 A3 40 7F (YY)* 7F 5Eas specified, transcoded from EBCDIC to ASCII\nAE 83 88 81 99 A2 85 A3 40 FC (YY)* FC 5Eas specified, transcoded from IBM1026 to ASCII\n00 63 68 61 72 73 65 74 20 22 (YY)* 22 3Bas specified, transcoded from GSM 03.38 to ASCII\nanalogous patternsUser agents may\n support additional, analogous, patterns if they support encodings\n that are not handled by the patterns here\n\n- If the encoding is detected based on one of the entries in the table\nabove marked \"as specified\", the user agent ignores the style sheet if it\ndoes not parse an appropriate @charset rule at the beginning of the\nstream of characters resulting from decoding in the chosen @charset.\nThis ensures that:\n \n\n @charset rules should only function if they are in the\n encoding of the style sheet,\n\n - byte order marks are ignored only\n in encodings that support a byte order mark, and\n\n - encoding names cannot contain newlines.\n\n \n\nUser agents must ignore style sheets in unknown encodings.",

      "content": "A style sheet may have to refer to characters that cannot be\nrepresented in the current character encoding. These characters must\nbe written as [escaped](#escaped-characters) references to\nISO 10646 characters. These escapes serve the same purpose as numeric\ncharacter references in HTML or XML documents (see [[HTML4]](refs.html#ref-HTML4),\nchapters 5 and 25).\n\nThe character escape mechanism should be used when only a few\ncharacters must be represented this way. If most of a style sheet\nrequires escaping, authors should encode it with a more appropriate\nencoding (e.g., if the style sheet contains a lot of Greek characters,\nauthors might use \"ISO-8859-7\" or \"UTF-8\").\n\nIntermediate processors using a different character encoding may\ntranslate these escaped sequences into byte sequences of that\nencoding. Intermediate processors must not, on\nthe other hand, alter escape sequences that cancel the special meaning\nof an ASCII character.\n\n[Conforming user agents](conform.html#conformance) must\ncorrectly map to ISO-10646 all characters in any character encodings\nthat they recognize (or they must behave as if they did).\n\nFor example, a style sheet transmitted as ISO-8859-1\n(Latin-1) cannot contain Greek letters directly:\n\"κουρος\" (Greek: \"kouros\") has to be\nwritten as \"\\3BA\\3BF\\3C5\\3C1\\3BF\\3C2\".\n\nNote.\nIn HTML 4,\nnumeric character references are interpreted in \"style\" attribute\nvalues but not in the content of the STYLE element. Because of this\nasymmetry, we recommend that authors use the CSS character\nescape mechanism rather than numeric character references\nfor both the \"style\" attribute and the STYLE element.\nFor example, we recommend:\n\n```\n\n<SPAN style=\"font-family: L\\FC beck\">...</SPAN>\n\n```\n\nrather than:\n\n```\n\n<SPAN style=\"font-family: Lübeck\">...</SPAN>\n\n```\n\n[previous](conform.html) \n[next](selector.html) \n[contents](Overview.html#minitoc) \n[properties](propidx.html) \n[index](indexlist.html)",
