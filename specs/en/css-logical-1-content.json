      "content": "Note: See [[css-writing-modes-4]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-4) for a proper introduction to writing modes;\n this module assumes familiarity with its terminology.\n\n \nBecause different writing systems are written in different directions,\n a variety of [writing modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode) exist:\n left to right, top to bottom;\n right to left, top to bottom;\n bottom to top, right to left;\n etc.\n logical concepts like the “start” of a page or line\n map differently to physical concepts like the “top” of a line or “left edge” of a paragraph.\n Some aspects of a layout are actually relative to the writing directions,\n and thus will vary when the page is translated to a different system;\n others are inherently relative to the page’s physical orientation.\n\n \n [](#example-6f979823) For example,\n lists, headings, and paragraphs are typically left-aligned in English;\n but actually they are start-aligned, because in Arabic the same constructs are right-aligned,\n and a multilingual document will need to accommodate both writing systems accordingly. \n \nThe following code exemplifies how using logical syntax can help you write code\n that works across different writing systems:\n\n \n \n Rendering of the below code in a compatible browser\n \n\n```\n<blockquote dir=\"auto\">Quotation in English</blockquote>\n<blockquote dir=\"auto\">اقتباس في العربية</blockquote>\n\n```\n\n```\nblockquote {\n text-align: start; /* left in latin, right in arabic */\n margin-inline-start: 0px; /* margin-left in latin, margin-right in arabic */\n border-inline-start: 5px solid gray; /* border-left in latin, border-right in arabic */\n padding-inline-start: 5px; /* padding-left in latin, padding-right in arabic */\n}\n\n```\n\n \nDocuments might need both logical and physical properties. For instance\n the drop shadows on buttons on a page must remain consistent throughout,\n so their offset will be chosen based on visual considerations and physical directions,\n and not vary by writing system.\n\n \n \nSince CSS was originally designed with only physical coordinates in its controls,\n this module introduces text-flow–relative equivalents\n so that declarations in a CSS style sheet can be expressed\n in [flow-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#flow-relative) terms.\n It defines the mapping and cascading of equivalent properties,\n some new properties and values equivalent to those in CSS2.1,\n and the principles used to derive their syntaxes.\n Future CSS specifications are expected to incorporate both sets of coordinates\n in their property and value definitions,\n so this module will not track the introduction of flow-relative variants\n of newer CSS features.\n\n \n[CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes/)’ [Abstract Box Terminology](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#abstract-box) section\n defines how to map between flow-relative and physical terms.\n This mapping,\n which depends on the [used values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) of [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode), [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction), and [text-orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-text-orientation),\n controls the interpretation of [flow-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#flow-relative) keywords and properties.\n\n \n \n \n Correspondence of physical and flow-relative terms in typical English text layout \n \n \n \n Correspondence of physical and flow-relative terms in vertical Chinese text layout \n \n \n \nNote: Due to its interaction with [text-orientation: upright](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-text-orientation),\n the [used](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction) depends on the [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode) and text-orientation.\n\n \n Tests\n \nGeneral tests for logical properties\n\n \n\n [getComputedStyle-listing.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-logical/getComputedStyle-listing.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-logical/getComputedStyle-listing.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-logical/getComputedStyle-listing.html)\n [inheritance.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-logical/inheritance.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-logical/inheritance.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-logical/inheritance.html)\n [logicalprops-quirklength.html](https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-logical/logicalprops-quirklength.html) [(live test)](http://wpt.live/css/css-logical/logicalprops-quirklength.html) [(source)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-logical/logicalprops-quirklength.html)\n \n\n \n \n \n [](#issue-3d880eb1) Things That Are Unstable Since implementation of parts of this module is effectively required\n for shipping an implementation of [CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/) on the Web\n (in order to correctly implement the default HTML styles),\n the CSSWG resolved that\n the requisite features in [§ 2 Flow-Relative Values: block-start, block-end, inline-start, inline-end](#directional-keywords) and [§ 4 Flow-Relative Box Model Properties](#box) are approved for shipping.\n (See [FPWD announcement](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2017Dec/0043.html) for additional background.) \n \nHowever, there are a few significant open issues:\n\n \n\n The logical keyword on shorthands,\n because the name of the keyword may change or it may be replaced by some other syntactic marker.\n (This feature will be deferred from this level for further development\n if there is no clearly satisfactory mechanism proposed,\n see [Issue 1282](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1282).) \n Whether flow-relative longhands inherit from their namesake on the parent,\n or are mapped to a physical property and inherit from that property.\n (See [Issue 3029](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3029).) \n Whether shorthands like [margin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-margin) expand to both sets of longhands,\n or only the ones that were set.\n (See [Issue 3030](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3030).) \n \n\n Comments, suggestions, and use cases are welcome on these issues.\n Please file them in GitHub, tweet them to @csswg, or send them to www-style@w3.org. \n \n 1.1.

[[CSS-CASCADE-3]](#biblio-css-cascade-3)\n\n \n Note that this requires implementations to maintain\n relative order of declarations within a CSS declaration block,\n which was not previously required for CSS cascading.\n It also requires that [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode), [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction), and [text-orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-text-orientation) be computed as a prerequisite for cascading together\n the

group](#logical-property-group) to find their [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value). \n\n \n [](#example-0ead529c) For example, given the following rule: \n\n```\np {\n margin-inline-start: 1px;\n margin-left: 2px;\n margin-inline-end: 3px;\n}\n\n```\n\n \nIn a paragraph with computed [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode) being [horizontal-tb](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-writing-mode-horizontal-tb) and computed [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#propdef-direction) being [ltr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-ltr),\n the computed value of [margin-left](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-margin-left) is 2px,\n since for that writing-mode and direction, [margin-inline-start](#propdef-margin-inline-start) and margin-left share a computed value,\n and the declaration of margin-left is after the declaration of margin-inline-start.\n However, if the computed direction were instead [rtl](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-rtl),\n the computed value of margin-left is 3px,\n since [margin-inline-end](#propdef-margin-inline-end) and margin-left share a computed value,\n and the declaration of margin-inline-end is after the declaration of margin-left.\n\n \n \n[[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) APIs that return computed values\n (such as `getComputedStyle()`)\n must return the same value for each individual property\n in such a pair.\n\n \nNote: Depending on the element’s own [writing mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#writing-mode) for mapping every [flow-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#flow-relative) property\n to its [physical](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#physical) equivalent\n simplifies the cascading calculations\n and gives a straightforward model for authors to reason about.\n However, it is problematic in many cases,\n see for example [this discussion](https://www.w3.org/mid/20161108202634.GA7235@mail.internode.on.net).\n Authors may need to use nested elements\n to get the correct mapping behavior\n when changing an element’s writing mode from its parent.\n\n \nInheritance of each property is from its corresponding property on the parent.\n For example, although the [inline-start](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-start) margin of an[rtl](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-rtl) box is its right margin, [margin-inline-start](#propdef-margin-inline-start) on this box will inherit\n the margin-inline-start of an [ltr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#valdef-direction-ltr) parent\n even though that happens to be the parent’s left margin.\n\n \nUnless otherwise specified, [shorthand properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#shorthand-property) that encompass both logical and physical
