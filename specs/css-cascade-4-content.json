Module Interactions[](#placement)\r\n \nThis section is normative.\n\r\n \nThis module replaces and extends\r\n the rules for assigning property values, cascading, and inheritance defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) chapter 6.\n\r\n \nOther CSS modules may expand the definitions of some of the syntax and features defined here.\r\n For example, the Media Queries Level 4 specification,\r\n when combined with this module, expands the definition of\r\n the [<media-query>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query) value type as used in this specification.\n\r\n \nFor the purpose of this specification, [text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#text-nodes) are treated as [element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#elements) children of their associated element,\r\n and possess the full set of properties;\r\n since they cannot be targeted by selectors\r\n all of their computed values are assigned by [defaulting](#defaulting).",

      "content": "The **@import** rule allows users to import style rules from other style sheets.\r\n If an [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rule refers to a valid stylesheet,\r\n user agents must treat the contents of the stylesheet as if they were written in place of the @import rule,\r\n with two exceptions:\n\r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nIf a feature\r\n(such as the @namespace rule) explicitly defines that it only applies to a particular stylesheet,\r\nand not any imported ones,\r\nthen it doesn’t apply to the imported stylesheet.\n\r\n \r\n \nIf a feature relies on the relative ordering of two or more constructs in a stylesheet\r\n(such as the requirement that @namespace rules must not have any other rules other than [@import](#at-ruledef-import) preceding it),\r\nit only applies between constructs in the same stylesheet.\n\r\n \n\r\n \n[](#example-d425da12) For example, declarations in style rules from imported stylesheets interact with the cascade\r\n as if they were written literally into the stylesheet at the point of the [@import](#at-ruledef-import). \n\r\n \nAny [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules must precede all other valid at-rules and style rules in a style sheet\r\n (ignoring [@charset](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#at-ruledef-charset)), or else the @import rule is invalid.\r\n The syntax of @import is:\n\r\n\n```\n@import [ [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) ]\r\n [ supports( [ [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition) [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) <declaration> ] ) ][?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt)\r\n [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list)[?](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-opt) ;\n```\n\r\n \nwhere the [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) or [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) gives the URL of the style sheet to be imported,\r\n and the optional [[<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition)|<declaration>] and [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list) (collectively, the **import conditions**)\r\n state the conditions under which it applies.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-05c74581) The following [conditional @import rule](#conditional-import) only loads the style sheet when the UA [supports](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-3/#support-definition) [display: flex](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display),\r\n and only applies the style sheet on a [handheld](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html#media-types) device\r\n with a [maximum viewport width](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#width) of 400px. \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"narrow.css\") supports(display: flex) handheld and (max-width: 400px);\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nIf a [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) is provided,\r\n it must be interpreted as a [<url>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#url-value) with the same value.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-da2e49cb) The following lines are equivalent in meaning\r\n and illustrate both [@import](#at-ruledef-import) syntaxes\r\n (one with [url()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#funcdef-url) and one with a bare string): \r\n\n```\n@import \"mystyle.css\";\r\n@import url(\"mystyle.css\");\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n 2.1. Conditional [@import](#at-ruledef-import) Rules[](#conditional-import)\r\n \nThe [import conditions](#import-conditions) allow the import to be media– or feature-support–dependent.\r\n In the absence of any import conditions, the import is unconditional.\r\n (Specifying [all](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#valdef-media-all) for the [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list) has the same effect.)\r\n If the import conditions do not match,\r\n the rules in the imported stylesheet do not apply,\r\n exactly as if the imported stylesheet were wrapped in [@media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-media) and/or [@supports](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#at-ruledef-supports) blocks with the given conditions.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-5fa651f3) The following rules illustrate how [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rules can be made media-dependent: \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"fineprint.css\") print;\r\n@import url(\"bluish.css\") projection, tv;\r\n@import url(\"narrow.css\") handheld and (max-width: 400px);\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nUser agents may therefore avoid fetching a conditional import\r\n as long as the [import conditions](#import-conditions) do not match.\r\n Additionally, if a [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition) blocks the application of the imported style sheet,\r\n the UA must not fetch the style sheet (unless it is loaded through some other link)\r\n and must return null for the import rule’s CSSImportRule.styleSheet value\r\n (even if it is loaded through some other link).\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-c6c2c0ee) The following rule illustrates how an author can provide fallback rules for legacy user agents\r\n without impacting network performance on newer user agents: \r\n\n```\n@import url(\"fallback-layout.css\") supports(not (display: flex));\r\n@supports (display: flex) {\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nThe [import conditions](#import-conditions) are given by [<media-query-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#typedef-media-query-list), which is parsed and interpreted as a [media query list](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#media-query-list),\r\n and [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition), is parsed and interpreted as a [[supports query]].\r\n If a <declaration> is given in place of a <supports-condition>,\r\n it must be interpreted as a [<supports-decl>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-decl) (i.e. the extra set of parentheses is implied)\r\n and treated as a <supports-condition>.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-75806df4) For example, the following two lines are equivalent: \r\n\n```\n@import \"mystyle.css\" supports(display: flex);\r\n@import \"mystyle.css\" supports((display: flex));\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nThe evaluation and full syntax of the [import conditions](#import-conditions) are defined by the [Media Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries/) [[MEDIAQ]](#biblio-mediaq) and [CSS Conditional Rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional/) [[CSS-CONDITIONAL-3]](#biblio-css-conditional-3) specifications.\n\r\n 2.2. Processing Stylesheet Imports[](#import-processing)\r\n \nWhen the same style sheet is imported or linked to a document in multiple places,\r\n user agents must process (or act as though they do) each link\r\n as though the link were to an independent style sheet.\n\r\n \nNote: This does not place any requirements on resource fetching,\r\n only how the style sheet is reflected in the CSSOM and used in specs such as this one.\r\n Assuming appropriate caching,\r\n it is perfectly appropriate for a UA to fetch a style sheet only once,\r\n even though it’s linked or imported multiple times.\n\r\n \nThe [cascade origin](#origin) of an imported style sheet is the cascade origin of the style sheet that imported it.\n\r\n \nThe [environment encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#environment-encoding) of an imported style sheet is the encoding of the style sheet that imported it. [[css-syntax-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3)\n\r\n \r\n To **fetch an @import[](#fetch-an-import)**, given an [@import](#at-ruledef-import) rule rule: \r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nLet parentStylesheet be rule’s [parent CSS style sheet](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#concept-css-rule-parent-css-style-sheet). [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom)\n\r\n \r\n \nIf rule has a [<supports-condition>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/#typedef-supports-condition),\r\nand that condition is not true,\r\nreturn.\n\r\n \r\n \nLet parsedUrl be the result of the [URL parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser) steps with rule’s URL and parentStylesheet’s [location](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#concept-css-style-sheet-location).\r\nIf the algorithm returns an error,\r\nreturn.

      "heading": "3.  Shorthand Properties",
      "content": "Some properties are **shorthand properties**,\r\n meaning that they allow authors to specify the values of several properties with a single property.\r\n A [shorthand property](#shorthand-property) sets all of its **longhand sub-properties**,\r\n exactly as if expanded in place.\n\r\n \nWhen values are omitted from a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) form,\r\n unless otherwise defined,\r\n each “missing” [sub-property](#longhand) is assigned its [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n \r\n This means that a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property declaration always sets all of its [sub-properties](#longhand),\r\n even those that are not explicitly set.\r\n Carelessly used, this might result in inadvertently resetting some sub-properties.\r\n Carefully used, a shorthand can guarantee a “blank slate”\r\n by resetting sub-properties inadvertently cascaded from other sources. \r\n \nFor example, writing [background: green](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background) rather than [background-color: green](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-color) ensures that the background color overrides any earlier declarations\r\n that might have set the background to an image with [background-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-image).\n\r\n \r\n \r\n [](#example-8762997a) For example, the CSS Level 1 [font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font) property\r\n is a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property for setting [font-style](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-style), [font-variant](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-variant), [font-weight](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-weight), [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size), [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height), and [font-family](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-family) all at once.\r\n The multiple declarations of this example: \r\n\n```\nh1 {\r\n font-weight: bold;\r\n font-size: 12pt;\r\n line-height: 14pt;\r\n font-family: Helvetica;\r\n font-variant: normal;\r\n font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n\n```\n\r\n \ncan therefore be rewritten as\n\r\n\n```\nh1 { font: bold 12pt/14pt Helvetica }\n```\n\r\n \nAs more [font](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font) [sub-properties](#longhand) are introduced into CSS,\r\n the shorthand declaration resets those to their initial values as well.\n\r\n \r\n \nIn some cases, a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) might have different syntax\r\n or special keywords\r\n that don’t directly correspond to values of its [sub-properties](#longhand).\r\n (In such cases, the shorthand will explicitly define the expansion of its values.)\n\r\n \nIn other cases, a property might be a **reset-only sub-property** of the shorthand:\r\n Like other [sub-properties](#longhand), it is reset to its initial value by the shorthand when unspecified,\r\n but the shorthand might not include syntax to set the sub-property to any of its other values. For example, the [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border) shorthand resets [border-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-image) to its initial value of none,\r\n but has no syntax to set it to anything else. [[css-backgrounds-3]](#biblio-css-backgrounds-3)\n\r\n \nIf a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) is specified as one of the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#common-keywords) [[css-values-3]](#biblio-css-values-3),\r\n it sets all of its [sub-properties](#longhand) to that keyword,\r\n including any that are [reset-only sub-properties](#reset-only-sub-property).\r\n (Note that these keywords cannot be combined with other values in a single declaration, not even in a shorthand.)\n\r\n \nDeclaring a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property to be !important is equivalent to declaring all of its [sub-properties](#longhand) to be !important.\n\r\n 3.1. Property Aliasing[](#aliasing)\r\n \nProperties sometimes change names after being supported for a while,\r\n such as vendor-prefixed properties being standardized.\r\n The original name still needs to be supported for compatibility reasons,\r\n but the new name is preferred.\r\n To accomplish this, CSS defines two different ways of “aliasing” old syntax to new syntax.\n\r\n \r\n **legacy name aliases** \r\n \r\n When the old property’s value syntax is identical\r\n to that of the new property,\r\n the two names are aliased with an operation on par with case-mapping:\r\n at parse time, the old property is converted into the new property.\r\n This conversion also applies in the CSSOM,\r\n both for string arguments and property accessors:\r\n requests for the old property name\r\n transparently transfer to the new property name instead. \r\n [](#example-5dd1d5a6) For example, if old-name is a [legacy name alias](#legacy-name-alias) for new-name, getComputedStyle(el).oldName will return the computed style of the newName property,\r\n and el.style.setPropertyValue(\"old-name\", \"value\") will set the new-name property to \"value\". \r\n **legacy shorthands** \r\n \r\n When the old property has a distinct syntax from the new property,\r\n the two names are aliased using the [shorthand](#shorthand-property) mechanism.\r\n These shorthands are defined to be [legacy shorthands](#legacy-shorthand),\r\n and their use is deprecated.\r\n They otherwise behave exactly as regular shorthands,\r\n except that the CSSOM will not use them\r\n when serializing declarations. [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) \r\n \r\n [](#example-c7a1887e) For example, the page-break-* properties\r\n are [legacy shorthands](#legacy-shorthand) for the break-* properties\r\n (see [CSS Fragmentation 3 § 3.4 Page Break Aliases: the page-break-before, page-break-after, and page-break-inside properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#page-break-properties)). \r\n \nSetting [page-break-before: always](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#propdef-page-break-before) expands to [break-before: page](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before) at parse time,\r\n like other shorthands do.\r\n Similarly, if break-before: page is set,\r\n calling getComputedStyle(el).pageBreakBefore will return \"always\".\r\n However, when serializing a style block\r\n (see [CSSOM 1 § 6.7.2 Serializing CSS Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values)),\r\n the page-break-before property will never be chosen as the shorthand to serialize to,\r\n regardless of whether it or break-before was specified;\r\n instead, break-before will always be chosen.\n\r\n \r\n \r\n 3.2.

[[css-writing-modes-3]](#biblio-css-writing-modes-3)\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-dae18981) For example, if an author specifies [all: initial](#propdef-all) on an element,\r\n it will block all inheritance and reset all properties,\r\n as if no rules appeared in the author, user, or user-agent levels of the cascade. \r\n \nThis can be useful for the root element of a \"widget\" included in a page,\r\n which does not wish to inherit the styles of the outer page.\r\n Note, however, that any \"default\" style applied to that element\r\n (such as, e.g. [display: block](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display) from the UA style sheet on block elements such as `<div>`)\r\n will also be blown away.",

      "content": "Once a user agent has parsed a document and constructed a document tree,\r\n it must assign,\r\n to every element in the [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#flat-tree),\r\n and correspondingly to every box in the formatting structure,\r\n a value to every property that applies to the target media type.\n\r\n \nThe final value of a CSS property for a given element or box\r\n is the result of a multi-step calculation:\n\r\n \n\r\n First, all the [declared values](#declared-value) applied to an element are collected,\r\n for each property on each element.\r\n There may be zero or many declared values applied to the element. \r\n Cascading yields the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value).\r\n There is at most one cascaded value per property per element. \r\n Defaulting yields the [specified value](#specified-value).\r\n Every element has exactly one specified value per property. \r\n Resolving value dependencies yields the [computed value](#computed-value).\r\n Every element has exactly one computed value per property. \r\n Formatting the document yields the [used value](#used-value).\r\n An element only has a used value for a given property\r\n if that property applies to the element. \r\n Finally, the used value is transformed to the [actual value](#actual-value) based on constraints of the display environment.\r\n As with the [used value](#used-value), there may or may not be an actual value for a given property on an element. \r\n \n\r\n \nElements that are not [connected](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#connected) or are not part of the document’s [flattened element tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#flat-tree) do not participate in CSS value processing,\r\n and do not have [declared](#declared-value), [cascaded](#cascaded-value), [specified](#specified-value), [computed](#computed-value), [used](#used-value), or [actual](#actual-value) values,\r\n even if they potentially have style declarations assigned to them\r\n (for example, by a `style` attribute).\n\r\n 4.1. Declared Values[](#declared)\r\n \nEach property declaration [applied to an element](#filtering) contributes a **declared value** for that property\r\n associated with the element.\r\n See [Filtering Declarations](#filtering) for details.\n\r\n \nThese values are then processed by the [cascade](#cascade) to choose a single “winning value”.\n\r\n 4.1.1. Value Aliasing[](#value-aliasing)\r\n \nSome property values have **legacy value aliases[](#css-legacy-value-alias)**:\r\n at parse time, the legacy syntax is converted into the new syntax,\r\n resulting in a [declared value](#declared-value) different from the parsed input.\r\n These aliases are typically used for handling legacy compatibility requirements,\r\n such as converting [vendor-prefixed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/#vendor-prefix) values to their standard equivalents.\n\r\n 4.2. Cascaded Values[](#cascaded)\r\n \nThe **cascaded value** represents the result of [the cascade](#cascade):\r\n it is the [declared value](#declared-value) that wins the cascade\r\n (is sorted first in the [output of the cascade](#output-of-the-cascade)).\r\n If the output of the cascade is an empty list,\r\n there is no [cascaded value](#cascaded-value).\n\r\n 4.3. Specified Values[](#specified)\r\n \nThe **specified value** is\r\n the value of a given property that the style sheet authors intended for that element.\r\n It is the result of putting the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) through the [defaulting](#defaulting) processes,\r\n guaranteeing that a [specified value](#specified-value) exists for every property on every element.\n\r\n \nIn many cases, the [specified value](#specified-value) is the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value).\r\n However, if there is no cascaded value at all,\r\n the specified value is [defaulted](#defaulting).\r\n The [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) are handled specially\r\n when they are the cascaded value of a property,\r\n setting the specified value as required by that keyword,\r\n see [§ 7.3 Explicit Defaulting](#defaulting-keywords).\n\r\n 4.4. Computed Values[](#computed)\r\n \nThe **computed value** is\r\n the result of resolving the [specified value](#specified-value) as defined in the “Computed Value” line of the property definition table,\r\n generally absolutizing it in preparation for [inheritance](#inheritance).\n\r\n \nNote: The [computed value](#computed-value) is the value that is transferred from parent to child during [inheritance](#inheritance).\r\n For historical reasons,\r\n it is not necessarily the value returned by the [getComputedStyle()](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle) function,\r\n which sometimes returns [used values](#used-value). [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom) Furthermore, the computed value is an abstract data representation:\r\n their definitions reflect that data representation,\r\n not how that data is serialized.\r\n For example, serialization rules often allow omitting certain values which are implied during parsing;\r\n but those values are nonetheless part of the computed value.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-29410c97) A [specified value](#specified-value) can be either absolute (i.e., not relative to another value, as in [red](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-red) or 2mm)\r\n or relative (i.e., relative to another value, as in [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto), 2em).\r\n Computing a relative value generally absolutizes it: \r\n \n\r\n values with relative units\r\n ([em](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#em), [ex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#ex), [vh](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#valdef-length-vh), [vw](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#valdef-length-vw))\r\n must be made absolute by multiplying with the appropriate reference size \r\n certain keywords\r\n (e.g., smaller, [bolder](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-weight-bolder))\r\n must be replaced according to their definitions \r\n percentages on some properties must be multiplied by a reference value\r\n (defined by the property) \r\n valid relative URLs must be resolved to become absolute. \r\n \n\r\n \nSee examples (f), (g) and (h) in the [table below](#stages-examples).\n\r\n \r\n \nNote: In general, the [computed value](#computed-value) resolves the [specified value](#specified-value) as far as possible without laying out the document\r\n or performing other expensive or hard-to-parallelize operations,\r\n such as resolving network requests\r\n or retrieving values other than from the element and its parent.\n\r\n \nThe [computed value](#computed-value) exists even when the property does not apply.\r\n However, some properties may change how they determine the computed value based on whether the property [applies to](#apply) the element.\n\r\n 4.5. Used Values[](#used)\r\n \nThe **used value** is\r\n the result of taking the [computed value](#computed-value) and completing any remaining calculations to make it the absolute theoretical value\r\n used in the formatting of the document.\n\r\n \n[](#example-aaa6b50b) For example, a declaration of [width: auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) can’t be resolved into a length without knowing the layout of the element’s ancestors,\r\n so the [computed value](#computed-value) is [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto),\r\n while the [used value](#used-value) is an absolute length, such as 100px. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) \n\r\n \n[](#example-aac2d669) As another example, a `<div>` might have a computed [break-before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-break-before) value of [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#valdef-justify-self-auto),\r\n but acquire a used break-before value of [page](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#valdef-break-before-page) by propagation from its first child. [[css-break-3]](#biblio-css-break-3) \n\r\n \nIf a property does not [apply to](#apply) this element or box type\r\n then it has no [used value](#used-value) for that property.\n\r\n \n[](#example-19a1092f) For example, the [flex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#propdef-flex) property has no [used value](#used-value) on elements that aren’t [flex items](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-item). \n\r\n 4.5.1. Applicable Properties[](#applies-to)\r\n \nIf a property does not **apply to** an element or box type—as noted in its “Applies to” line—this means it does not directly take effect on that type of box or element.\n\r\n \nNote: A property that does not apply\r\n can still have indirect formatting effects\r\n if its computed value affects the computation of other properties\r\n that do apply;\r\n and of course its [computed value](#computed-value),\r\n which always exists,\r\n can still inherit to descendants\r\n and take effect on them.\n\r\n [](#example-9b82d3cf) Even though [writing-mode](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-writing-mode) and [text-orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#propdef-text-orientation) do not apply to table rows\r\n (they do not affect how the table row or its children are laid out),\r\n setting them on such boxes\r\n will still affect the calculation of font relative units such as [ch](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#ch),\r\n and thus possibly any property that takes a [<length>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#length-value). \r\n [](#example-c1c9d619) Setting [text-transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-transform) on an HTML `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` element\r\n (which is [display: block](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display) by default)\r\n will have an effect,\r\n even though text-transform only applies to [inline boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-box),\r\n because the property inherits\r\n into the paragraph’s anonymous [root inline box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#root-inline-box) and applies to the text it contains. \r\n \nNote: A property defined to apply to “all elements”\r\n applies to all elements and [display types](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#display-type),\r\n but not necessarily to all [pseudo-element](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element) types,\r\n since pseudo-elements often have their own specific rendering models\r\n or other restrictions.\r\n The [::before](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-before) and [::after](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-after) pseudo-elements, however,\r\n are defined to generate boxes almost exactly like normal elements\r\n and are therefore defined accept all properties that apply to “all elements”.\r\n See [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4) for more information about pseudo-elements.\n\r\n 4.6. Actual Values[](#actual)\r\n \nA [used value](#used-value) is in principle ready to be used,\r\n but a user agent may not be able to make use of the value in a given environment. For example, a user agent may only be able to render borders with integer pixel widths\r\n and may therefore have to approximate the [used](#used-value) width.\r\n Also, the font size of an element may need adjustment based on the availability of fonts\r\n or the value of the [font-size-adjust](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#propdef-font-size-adjust) property. The **actual value** is\r\n the used value after any such adjustments have been made.\n\r\n \nNote: By probing the actual values of elements,\r\n much can be learned about how the document is laid out.\r\n However, not all information is recorded in the actual values.\r\n For example, the actual value of the [page-break-after](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#propdef-page-break-after) property\r\n does not reflect whether there is a page break or not after the element.\r\n Similarly, the actual value of [orphans](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#propdef-orphans) does not reflect how many orphan lines there is in a certain element.\r\n See examples (j) and (k) in the [table below](#stages-examples).\n\r\n 4.7.

Cascade Sorting Order[](#cascade-sort)\r\n \nThe cascade sorts declarations according to the following criteria,\r\n in descending order of priority:\n\r\n \r\n [](#cascade-origin)Origin and Importance \r\n \r\n The [origin](#origin) of a declaration is based on where it comes from\r\n and its [importance](#important) is\r\n whether or not it is declared with !important (see [below](#importance)).\r\n The precedence of the various origins is, in descending order: \r\n \n\r\n Transition declarations [[css-transitions-1]](#biblio-css-transitions-1) \r\n [Important](#important) [user agent](#cascade-origin-ua) declarations \r\n [Important](#important) [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations \r\n [Important](#important) [author](#cascade-origin-author) declarations \r\n Animation declarations [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1) \r\n [Normal](#normal) [author](#cascade-origin-author) declarations \r\n [Normal](#normal) [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations \r\n [Normal](#normal) [user agent](#cascade-origin-ua) declarations \r\n \n\r\n \nDeclarations from [origins](#origin) earlier in this list win over declarations from later origins.\n\r\n [](#cascade-context)Context \r\n \r\n A document language can provide for blending declarations sourced\r\n from different **encapsulation contexts**,\r\n such as the nested [tree contexts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#tree-context) of [shadow trees](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scoping-1/#shadow-tree) in the [[DOM]](#biblio-dom). \r\n \nWhen comparing two declarations\r\n that are sourced from different [encapsulation contexts](#encapsulation-contexts),\r\n then for [normal](#normal) rules\r\n the declaration from the outer context wins,\r\n and for [important](#important) rules\r\n the declaration from the inner context wins.\r\n For this purpose, [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) [tree contexts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#tree-context) are considered to be nested\r\n in [shadow-including tree order](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-tree-order).\n\r\n \nNote: This effectively means that [normal](#normal) declarations belonging to an [encapsulation context](#encapsulation-contexts) can set defaults that are easily overridden by the outer context,\r\n while [important](#important) declarations belonging to an encapsulation context can enforce requirements that cannot be overridden by the outer context.\n\r\n [](#cascade-specificity)Specificity \r\n The [Selectors module](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity) [[SELECT]](#biblio-select) describes how to compute the specificity of a selector.\r\n Each declaration has the same specificity as the style rule it appears in.\r\n For the purpose of this step,\r\n declarations that do not belong to a style rule\r\n (such as the [contents of a style attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-style-attr/#interpret))\r\n are considered to have a specificity higher than any selector.\r\n The declaration with the highest specificity wins. \r\n [](#cascade-order)Order of Appearance \r\n \r\n The last declaration in document order wins.\r\n For this purpose: \r\n \n\r\n Declarations from [imported style sheets](#at-ruledef-import) are ordered as if their style sheets were substituted in place of the @import rule. \r\n Declarations from style sheets independently linked by the originating document\r\n are treated as if they were concatenated in linking order,\r\n as determined by the host document language. \r\n Declarations from style attributes\r\n are ordered according to the document order of the element the style attribute appears on,\r\n and are all placed after any style sheets. \r\n \n\r\n \r\n \nThe **output of the cascade** is a (potentially empty) sorted list of [declared values](#declared-value) for each property on each element.\n\r\n 6.2. Cascading Origins[](#cascading-origins)\r\n \nEach style rule has a **cascade origin**,\r\n which determines where it enters the cascade.\r\n CSS defines three core [origins](#origin):\n\r\n \r\n **Author Origin** \r\n The author specifies style sheets for a source document\r\n according to the conventions of the document language.\r\n For instance, in HTML,\r\n style sheets may be included in the document or linked externally. \r\n **User Origin** \r\n The user may be able to specify style information for a particular document.\r\n For example, the user may specify a file that contains a style sheet\r\n or the user agent may provide an interface that generates a user style sheet\r\n (or behaves as if it did). \r\n **User-Agent Origin** \r\n Conforming user agents must apply a default style sheet\r\n (or behave as if they did).\r\n A user agent’s default style sheet should present the elements of the document language\r\n in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations for the document language\r\n (e.g., for visual browsers, the EM element in HTML is presented using an italic font).\r\n See e.g. the [HTML user agent style sheet](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints). [[HTML]](#biblio-html) \r\n \r\n \nExtensions to CSS define the following additional [origins](#origin):\n\r\n \r\n **Animation Origin[](#cascade-origin-animation)** \r\n CSS Animations [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1) generate “virtual” rules representing their effects when running. \r\n **Transition Origin[](#cascade-origin-transition)** \r\n Like CSS Animations, CSS Transitions [[css-transitions-1]](#biblio-css-transitions-1) generate “virtual” rules representing their effects when running. \r\n \r\n 6.3. Important Declarations: the !important annotation[](#importance)\r\n \nCSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets.\r\n By default, rules in an author’s style sheet override those in a user’s style sheet,\r\n which override those in the user-agent’s default style sheet.\r\n To balance this, a declaration can be marked [important](#important),\r\n which increases its weight in the cascade and inverts the order of precedence.\n\r\n \nA declaration is **important** if it has a !important annotation as defined by [[css-syntax-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3),\r\n i.e. if the last two (non-whitespace, non-comment) tokens\r\n in its value are the delimiter token ! followed by the identifier token important.\r\n All other declarations are **normal** (non-[important](#important)).\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-813b5c64) \r\n\n```\n[hidden] { display: none !important; }\n```\n\r\n \r\n \nAn [important](#important) declaration takes precedence over a [normal](#normal) declaration.\r\n Author and user style sheets may contain important declarations,\r\n with [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) important declarations\r\n overriding [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) important declarations.\r\n This CSS feature improves accessibility of documents\r\n by giving users with special requirements\r\n (large fonts, color combinations, etc.)\r\n control over presentation.\n\r\n \n[Important](#important) declarations from all origins take precedence over animations.\r\n This allows authors to override animated values in important cases.\r\n (Animated values normally override all other rules.) [[css-animations-1]](#biblio-css-animations-1)\n\r\n \n[User-agent style sheets](#cascade-origin-ua) may also contain [important](#important) declarations.\r\n These override all [author](#cascade-origin-author) and [user](#cascade-origin-user) declarations.\n\r\n \r\n [](#example-b189d121) The first rule in the user’s style sheet in the following example contains an !important declaration,\r\n which overrides the corresponding declaration in the author’s style sheet.\r\n The declaration in the second rule will also win due to being marked !important.\r\n However, the third declaration in the user’s style sheet is not !important and will therefore lose to the second rule in the author’s style sheet\r\n (which happens to set style on a [shorthand](#shorthand-property) property).\r\n Also, the third author rule will lose to the second author rule since the second declaration is !important.\r\n This shows that !important declarations have a function also within author style sheets. \r\n\n```\n/* From the user’s style sheet */\r\np { text-indent: 1em !important }\r\np { font-style: italic !important }\r\np { font-size: 18pt }\r\n\r\n/* From the author’s style sheet */\r\np { text-indent: 1.5em !important }\r\np { font: normal 12pt sans-serif !important }\r\np { font-size: 24pt }\r\n\n```\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Property \r\n Winning value \r\n \r\n \r\n [text-indent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#propdef-text-indent) \r\n 1em \r\n \r\n [font-style](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-style) \r\n [italic](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-style-italic) \r\n \r\n [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-5/#descdef-font-face-font-size) \r\n 12pt \r\n \r\n [font-family](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-family) \r\n [sans-serif](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#valdef-font-family-sans-serif) \r\n \r\n \r\n 6.4. Precedence of Non-CSS Presentational Hints[](#preshint)\r\n \nThe UA may choose to honor presentational hints in a source document’s markup,\r\n for example the `bgcolor` attribute or `[s](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element)` element in [[HTML]](#biblio-html).\r\n All document language-based styling must be translated to corresponding CSS rules\r\n and enter the cascade as rules in either\r\n the [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) or a special-purpose **author presentational hint origin** between the regular [user origin](#cascade-origin-user) and the [author origin](#cascade-origin-author).\r\n For the purpose of [cascading](#cascade) this [author presentational hint origin](#author-presentational-hint-origin) is treated as an independent [origin](#origin),\r\n but for the purpose of the [revert](#valdef-all-revert) keyword\r\n it is considered part of the author origin.\n\r\n \nA document language may define whether such a presentational hint\r\n enters the [cascade](#cascade) as [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) or [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author);\r\n if so, the UA must behave accordingly.\r\n For example, [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11) maps its presentation attributes into the author origin.\n\r\n \nNote: Presentational hints entering the [cascade](#cascade) as [UA-origin](#cascade-origin-ua) rules\r\n can be overridden by [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) or [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) styles.\r\n Presentational hints entering the cascade as [author presentational hint origin](#author-presentational-hint-origin) rules\r\n can be overridden by author-origin styles,\r\n but not by non-[important](#important) user-origin styles.\r\n Host languages should choose the appropriate origin for presentational hints\r\n with these considerations in mind.",

[Inherited properties](#inherited-property) draw their defaults from their parent element through [inheritance](#inheritance);\r\n all other properties take their [initial value](#initial-value).\r\n Authors can explicitly request inheritance or initialization\r\n via the [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit) and [initial](#valdef-all-initial) keywords.\n\r\n 7.1. Initial Values[](#initial-values)\r\n \nEach property has an **initial value**,\r\n defined in the property’s definition table.\r\n If the property is not an [inherited property](#inherited-property),\r\n and the [cascade](#cascade) does not result in a value,\r\n then the [specified value](#specified-value) of the property is its [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n 7.2. Inheritance[](#inheriting)\r\n \n**Inheritance** propagates property values from parent elements to their children.\r\n The **inherited value** of a property on an element\r\n is the [computed value](#computed-value) of the property on the element’s parent element.\r\n For the root element,\r\n which has no parent element,\r\n the [inherited value](#inherited-value) is the [initial value](#initial-value) of the property.\n\r\n \nFor a [[DOM]](#biblio-dom) tree with shadows,\r\n inheritance operates on the [flattened element tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/#flat-tree). This means that slotted elements inherit from the `[slot](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-slot-element)` they’re assigned to,\r\n rather than directly from their [light tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-light-tree) parent. [Pseudo-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element) inherit according to the fictional tag sequence\r\n described for each pseudo-element. [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]](#biblio-css-pseudo-4)\n\r\n \nSome properties are **inherited properties**,\r\n as defined in their property definition table.\r\n This means that,\r\n unless the [cascade](#cascade) results in a value,\r\n the value will be determined by [inheritance](#inheritance).\n\r\n \nA property can also be explicitly inherited. See the [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit) keyword.\n\r\n \nNote: Inheritance follows the document tree and is not intercepted by [anonymous boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#box-gen),\r\n or otherwise affected by manipulations of the box tree.\n\r\n 7.3. Explicit Defaulting[](#defaulting-keywords)\r\n \nSeveral CSS-wide property values are defined below;\r\n declaring a property to have these values explicitly specifies a particular defaulting behavior.\r\n As specified in [CSS Values and Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#common-keywords) [[css-values-3]](#biblio-css-values-3),\r\n all CSS properties can accept these values.\n\r\n 7.3.1. Resetting a Property: the [initial](#valdef-all-initial) keyword[](#initial)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **initial** keyword,\r\n the property’s [specified value](#specified-value) is its [initial value](#initial-value).\n\r\n 7.3.2. Explicit Inheritance: the [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit) keyword[](#inherit)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **inherit** keyword,\r\n the property’s [specified](#specified-value) and [computed values](#computed-value) are the [inherited value](#inherited-value).\n\r\n 7.3.3. Erasing All Declarations: the [unset](#valdef-all-unset) keyword[](#inherit-initial)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **unset** keyword,\r\n then if it is an inherited property, this is treated as [inherit](#valdef-all-inherit),\r\n and if it is not, this is treated as [initial](#valdef-all-initial).\r\n This keyword effectively erases all [declared values](#declared-value) occurring earlier in the [cascade](#cascade),\r\n correctly inheriting or not as appropriate for the property\r\n (or all longhands of a [shorthand](#shorthand-property)).\n\r\n 7.3.4. Rolling Back Cascade Origins: the [revert](#valdef-all-revert) keyword[](#default)\r\n \nIf the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) of a property is\r\n the **revert** keyword,\r\n the behavior depends on the [cascade origin](#origin) to which the declaration belongs:\n\r\n \r\n [user-agent origin](#cascade-origin-ua) \r\n Equivalent to [unset](#valdef-all-unset). \r\n [user origin](#cascade-origin-user) \r\n Rolls back the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) to the user-agent level,\r\n so that the [specified value](#specified-value) is calculated\r\n as if no [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) or [user-origin](#cascade-origin-user) rules were specified\r\n for this property on this element. \r\n [author origin](#cascade-origin-author) \r\n Rolls back the [cascaded value](#cascaded-value) to the user level,\r\n so that the [specified value](#specified-value) is calculated\r\n as if no [author-origin](#cascade-origin-author) rules were specified\r\n for this property on this element.\r\n For the purpose of [revert](#valdef-all-revert), this origin includes the Animation [origin](#origin).",
