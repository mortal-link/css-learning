More precisely, it specifies the indentation of the\nfirst box that flows into the block's first [line box](visuren.html#line-box). The box is indented with\nrespect to the left (or right, for right-to-left layout) edge of the\nline box. User agents must render this indentation as blank space.\n\n'Text-indent' only affects a line if it is the [first formatted line](selector.html#first-line-pseudo) of an\nelement. For example, the first line of an anonymous block box is only\naffected if it is the first child of its parent element.\n\nValues have the following meanings:\n\n[<length>](syndata.html#value-def-length)\nThe indentation is a fixed length.\n[<percentage>\n](syndata.html#value-def-percentage)\nThe indentation is a percentage of the containing\nblock width.\n\nThe value of ['text-indent'](text.html#propdef-text-indent) may be negative, but\nthere may be implementation-specific limits. \nIf the value of ['text-indent'](text.html#propdef-text-indent) is either negative or\nexceeds the width of the block, that first box, described above,\ncan overflow the block.\nThe value of ['overflow'](visufx.html#propdef-overflow) will affect\nwhether such text that overflows the block is visible.\n\nExample(s):\n\nThe following example causes a '3em' text indent.\n\n```\n\np { text-indent: 3em }\n\n```\n\nNote: Since the 'text-indent' property inherits, when specified on\na block element, it will affect descendant inline-block elements. \nFor this reason, it is often wise to specify '`text-indent: 0`' \non elements that are specified '`display:inline-block`'.",

In the case of 'left', 'right' and 'center', this property specifies\nhow the inline-level boxes within each line box align with respect to the line\nbox's left and right sides; alignment is not with respect to the [viewport](visuren.html#viewport). In the case of 'justify',\nthis property specifies that the inline-level boxes are to be made flush\nwith both sides of the line box if possible, by expanding or contracting\nthe contents of inline boxes, else aligned as for the initial\nvalue.

For all other elements it is propagated to any in-flow\nchildren. Note that text decorations are not propagated to floating\nand absolutely positioned descendants, nor to the contents of atomic\ninline-level descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.\n\nUnderlines, overlines, and line-throughs are applied only to text\n(including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing): margins,\nborders, and padding are skipped.\nUser agents must not render these text decorations on content that is\nnot text. For example, images and inline blocks must not be underlined.\n\nNote. If an element E has both 'visibility:\nhidden' and 'text-decoration: underline', the underline is invisible\n(although any decoration of E's parent is visible.) \nHowever, CSS 2.2 does not specify if the underline is visible or\ninvisible in E's children:\n\n```\n\n<span style=\"visibility: hidden; text-decoration: underline\">\n <span style=\"visibility: visible\">\n underlined or not?\n </span>\n</span>\n\n```\n\nThis is expected to be specified in level 3 of CSS.\n\nThe 'text-decoration' property on descendant elements cannot have any\neffect on the decoration of the ancestor. In determining the position\nof and thickness of text decoration lines, user agents may consider the\nfont sizes of and dominant baselines of descendants, but must use the\nsame baseline and thickness on each line. Relatively positioning a\ndescendant moves all text decorations affecting it along with the\ndescendant's text; it does not affect calculation of the decoration's\ninitial position on that line.\n\nValues have the following meanings:\n\nnone\nProduces no text decoration.\nunderline\nEach line of text is underlined.\noverline\nEach line of text has a line above it.\nline-through\nEach line of text has a line through the middle.\nblink\nText blinks (alternates between visible and invisible).\n[Conforming user agents](conform.html#conformance)\nmay simply not blink the text. Note that not blinking the text \nis one technique to satisfy \n[checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-on-off-blinking-text).\n\nThe color(s) required for the text decoration must be derived from \nthe ['color'](colors.html#propdef-color) property value of the element on which 'text-decoration' \nis set. The color of decorations must remain the same even if \ndescendant elements have different ['color'](colors.html#propdef-color) values.\n\nSome user agents have implemented text-decoration by \npropagating the decoration to the descendant elements as opposed to \npreserving a constant thickness and line position as described \nabove. This was arguably allowed by the looser wording in CSS2. SVG1, \nCSS1-only, and CSS2-only user agents may implement the older model \nand still claim conformance to this part of CSS 2.2. (This does not \napply to UAs developed after this specification was released.)\n\nExample(s):\n\nIn the following example for HTML, the text content of all \nA elements acting as hyperlinks (whether visited or not) will be underlined:\n\n```\n\na:visited,a:link { text-decoration: underline }\n\n```\n\nExample(s):\n\nIn the following style sheet and document fragment:\n\n```\n\n blockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }\n em { display: block; }\n cite { color: fuchsia; }\n\n```\n\n```\n\n <blockquote>\n <p>\n <span>\n Help, help!\n <em> I am under a hat! </em>\n <cite> —GwieF </cite>\n </span>\n </p>\n </blockquote>\n\n```\n\n...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an \nanonymous inline element that surrounds the span element, causing \nthe text \"Help, help!\" to be blue, with the blue underlining from \nthe anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the \nblockquote element. The `<em>text</em>` \nin the em block is also underlined,\nas it is in an in-flow block to which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia, but the underline \nunderneath it is still the blue underline from the anonymous inline \nelement.\n\nThis diagram shows the boxes involved in the example above. The rounded\naqua line represents the anonymous inline element wrapping the inline\ncontents of the paragraph element, the rounded blue line represents\nthe span element, and the orange lines represent the blocks.",
