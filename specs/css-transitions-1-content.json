      "content": "Normally when the value of a CSS property changes, the rendered result is instantly updated, with the affected elements immediately changing from the old property value to the new property value. This section describes a way to specify gradual transitions using new CSS properties. These properties are used to animate smoothly from the old state to the new state over time. \n\n \n For example, suppose that transitions of one second have been defined on the [left](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-left) and [background-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-color) properties. The following diagram illustrates the effect of updating those properties on an element, in this case moving it to the right and changing the background from red to blue. This assumes other transition parameters still have their default values. \n\n \n \n Transitions of [left](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-left) and [background-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-color). \n \n \n Transitions are a presentational effect. The [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of a property transitions over time from the old value to the new value. Therefore if a script queries the computed value of a property (or other data depending on it) as it is transitioning, it will see an intermediate value that represents the current animated value of the property. \n\n \n The transition for a property is defined using a number of new properties. For example: \n\n \n [](#example-c14634d9) \n \n Example(s): \n\n```\ndiv {\n transition-property: opacity;\n transition-duration: 2s;\n}\n\n```\n\n The above example defines a transition on the [opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-opacity) property that, when a new value is assigned to it, will cause a smooth change between the old value and the new value over a period of two seconds. \n \n \n Each of the transition properties accepts a comma-separated list, allowing multiple transitions to be defined, each acting on a different property. In this case, the individual transitions take their parameters from the same index in all the lists. For example: \n\n \n [](#example-0825db11) \n \n Example(s): \n\n```\ndiv {\n transition-property: opacity, left;\n transition-duration: 2s, 4s;\n}\n\n```\n\n This will cause the [opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-opacity) property to transition over a period of two seconds and the left property to transition over a period of four seconds. \n \n \n In the case where the lists of values in transition properties\n do not have the same length, the length of the [transition-property](#propdef-transition-property) list determines the number of items in\n each list examined when starting transitions. The lists are\n matched up from the first value: excess values at the end are\n not used. If one of the other properties doesn’t have enough\n comma-separated values to match the number of values of transition-property, the user agent must calculate its used value by\n repeating the list of values until there are enough. This\n truncation or repetition does not affect the computed value. Note: This is analogous to the behavior of the background-* properties, with [background-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-image) analogous to [transition-property](#propdef-transition-property). \n\n \n [](#example-d94cbd75) \n \n Example(s): \n\n```\ndiv {\n transition-property: opacity, left, top, width;\n transition-duration: 2s, 1s;\n}\n\n```\n\n The above example defines a transition on the [opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-opacity) property of 2 seconds duration, a transition on the [left](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-left) property of 1\n second duration, a transition on the [top](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-top) property of 2 seconds duration and a\n transition on the [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-width) property of 1\n second duration. \n \n \n While authors can use transitions to create dynamically changing content,\n dynamically changing content can lead to seizures in some users.\n For information on how to avoid content that can lead to seizures, see [Guideline 2.3:\n Seizures:\n Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#seizure) ([[WCAG20]](#biblio-wcag20)). \n\n \n Tests\n \n\n

The [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) Property[](#transition-delay-property)\n \n The [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) property defines when the transition will start.

Otherwise, the value specifies an offset from the moment the property is changed, and the transition will delay execution by that offset. \n\n \n If the value for [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) is a negative time offset then the transition will execute the moment the property is changed, but will appear to have begun execution at the specified offset. That is, the transition will appear to begin part-way through its play cycle.

This specification maintains the invariant that\n there is never both a [running transition](#running-transition) and\n a [completed transition](#completed-transition) for the same property and element. \n\n \n If an element is no longer in the document,\n implementations must [cancel](#transition-cancel) any [running transitions](#running-transition) on it and remove transitions on it from the [completed transitions](#completed-transition). \n\n \n \n This set of completed transitions\n needs to be maintained\n in order to prevent\n transitions from repeating themselves in certain cases,\n i.e., to maintain the invariant\n that this specification tries to maintain\n that unrelated style changes do not trigger transitions. \n\n \n[](#example-4b88a0cc) An example where maintaining the set of completed transitions\n is necessary would be a transition on\n an inherited property,\n where the parent specifies a transition of that property for\n a longer duration (say, [transition: 4s text-indent](#propdef-transition))\n and a child element that inherits the parent’s value specifies\n a transition of the same property for a shorter duration\n (say, transition: 1s text-indent).\n Without the maintenance of this set of completed transitions,\n implementations could start additional transitions on the child\n after the initial 1 second transition on the child completes. \n\n \n \n Various things can cause the [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of properties\n on an element to change.\n These include\n insertion and removal of elements from the document tree\n (which both changes whether those elements have computed values and\n can change the styles of other elements through selector matching),\n changes to the document tree that cause\n changes to which selectors match elements,\n changes to style sheets or style attributes,\n and other things.\n This specification does not define when computed values are updated,\n beyond saying that implementations must not\n use, present, or display something resulting from the CSS\n cascading, value computation, and inheritance process [[CSS3CASCADE]](#biblio-css3cascade) without updating the computed value (which means merely that implementations cannot avoid\n meeting requirements of this specification\n by claiming not to have updated the computed value as part of handling a style change).\n However,\n when an implementation updates the computed value of a\n property on an element\n to reflect one of these changes,\n or computes the computed value of a property on an element\n newly added to the document,\n it must update the computed value for all properties and elements to reflect all\n of these changes at the same time\n (or at least it must be undetectable that it was done at a\n different time).\n This processing of a set of simultaneous style changes is called a **style change event**.\n (Implementations typically have a [style change event](#style-change-event) to\n correspond with their desired screen refresh rate,\n and when up-to-date computed style or layout information is needed\n for a script API that depends on it.) \n\n \n Tests\n \n\n

define\n when a [style change event](#style-change-event) occurs,\n and thus what changes to computed values are considered simultaneous,\n authors should be aware that changing any of the transition\n properties a small amount of time after making a change that\n might transition can result in behavior that varies between\n implementations, since the changes might be considered\n simultaneous in some implementations but not others. \n\n \n When a [style change event](#style-change-event) occurs,\n implementations must start transitions based on\n the [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) that changed in that event.\n If an element is not in the document during that\n style change event or was not in the document during\n the previous style change event,\n then transitions are not started for that element\n in that style change event.\n Otherwise,\n define the **before-change style** as\n the computed values of all properties on the element as of\n the previous style change event,\n except with any styles derived from declarative\n animations such as CSS Transitions, CSS Animations\n ([[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]](#biblio-css3-animations)),\n and SMIL Animations ([[SMIL-ANIMATION]](#biblio-smil-animation), [[SVG11]](#biblio-svg11))\n updated to the current time.\n Likewise, define the **after-change style** as\n the computed values of all properties\n on the element based on the information\n known at the start of that style change event,\n but using the computed values of the animation-* properties from the [before-change style](#before-change-style),\n excluding any styles from CSS Transitions in the computation,\n and inheriting from\n the [after-change style](#after-change-style) of the parent.\n Note that this means the after-change style does not differ from\n the before-change style due to newly created or canceled CSS\n Animations. \n\n \n

style](#after-change-style) means that a single change\n can start a transition on the same property\n on both an ancestor element and its descendant element.\n This can happen when a property change is inherited\n from one element with transition-* properties\n that say to animate the changing property\n to another element with transition-* properties\n that also say to animate the changing property. \n\n \n When this happens, both transitions will run,\n and the transition on the descendant will override\n the transition on the ancestor\n because of the normal\n CSS cascading and inheritance rules ([[CSS3CASCADE]](#biblio-css3cascade)). \n\n \n If the transition on the descendant completes before\n the transition on the ancestor,\n the descendant will then resume inheriting\n the (still transitioning) value from its parent.\n This effect is likely not a desirable effect,\n but it is essentially doing what the author asked for. \n\n \n \n For each element with a [before-change style](#before-change-style) and\n an [after-change style](#after-change-style),\n and each property (other than shorthands),\n define the **matching transition-property value** as\n the last value in the [transition-property](#propdef-transition-property) in the element’s after-change style that matches the property,\n as described in [§ 2.1 The transition-property Property](#transition-property-property).\n If there is such a value, then corresponding to it, there is\n a **matching transition duration**,\n a **matching transition delay**, and\n a **matching transition timing function** in the values in the after-change style of [transition-duration](#propdef-transition-duration), [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay), and [transition-timing-function](#propdef-transition-timing-function) (see [the rules on matching lists](#list-matching)).\n Define the **combined duration** of the transition\n as the sum of max([matching transition duration](#matching-transition-duration), 0s) and\n the [matching transition delay](#matching-transition-delay). \n\n \nWhen comparing the [before-change style](#before-change-style) and [after-change style](#after-change-style) for a given property,\n the property values are **transitionable** if they have an [animation type](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#animation-type) that is neither [not animatable](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#not-animatable) nor [discrete](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#discrete).\n\n \nNote: Even if a property is defined to have an [animation type](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#animation-type) that is not [discrete](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#discrete),\n for a particular pair of property values the animation type may be discrete.\n For example,\n the animation type of the [box-shadow](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-box-shadow) property is [shadow list](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#combining-shadow-lists),\n which defines that\n when the [inset](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#shadow-inset) keyword is absent in one value\n but present in the other, discrete animation is used.\n As a result 0px 0px black and inset 10px 10px black are not [transitionable](#transitionable).\n\n \nFor each element and property, the implementation must act\n as follows:\n\n \n\n \n If all of the following are true: \n \n\n the element does not have\n a [running transition](#running-transition) for the property, \n the [before-change style](#before-change-style) is different from\n the [after-change style](#after-change-style) for that property,\n and the values for the property are [transitionable](#transitionable), \n the element does not have a [completed transition](#completed-transition) for the property\n or the [end

\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Note that the above rules mean that\n when the computed value of an animatable property changes,\n the transitions that start are based on the\n values of the [transition-property](#propdef-transition-property), [transition-duration](#propdef-transition-duration), [transition-timing-function](#propdef-transition-timing-function), and [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) properties\n at the time the animatable property would first have its new\n computed value.\n This means that when one of these transition-* properties\n changes at the same time as\n a property whose change might transition,\n it is the new values of the transition-* properties\n that control the transition. \n\n \n [](#manual-reversing-example) \n \n Example(s): \n\n \nThis provides a way for authors to specify different values\n of the transition-* properties for the “forward”\n and “reverse” transitions,\n when the transitions are between two states\n (but see [below](#reversing) for special reversing behavior when\n an incomplete transition is interrupted). Authors can\n specify the value of [transition-duration](#propdef-transition-duration), [transition-timing-function](#propdef-transition-timing-function), or [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) in the same\n rule where they specify the value that triggers the transition,\n or can change these properties at the same time as they change\n the property that triggers the transition. Since it’s the new\n values of these transition-* properties that affect the\n transition, these values will be used for the transitions to the associated transitioning values. For example: \n\n```\nli {\n transition: background-color linear 1s;\n background: blue;\n}\nli:hover {\n background-color: green;\n transition-duration: 2s; /* applies to the transition *to* the :hover state */\n}\n```\n\n \n When a list item with these style rules enters the :hover\n state, the computed [transition-duration](#propdef-transition-duration) at the time that [background-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-color) would have its new value ([green](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-green)) is 2s,\n so the transition from [blue](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-blue) to green takes 2 seconds.\n However, when the list item leaves the :hover state, the\n transition from green to blue takes 1 second. \n\n \n \n \n Note that once the transition of a property has started\n (including being in its delay phase),\n it continues running based on\n the original timing function, duration, and\n delay, even if the [transition-timing-function](#propdef-transition-timing-function), [transition-duration](#propdef-transition-duration), or [transition-delay](#propdef-transition-delay) property changes\n before the transition is complete. However, if the [transition-property](#propdef-transition-property) property changes such that the transition\n would not have started, the transition stops (and the\n property immediately changes to its final value). \n\n \n Note that above rules mean that\n transitions do not start when the computed\n value of a property changes as a result of declarative animation\n (as opposed to scripted animation).\n This happens because the before-change style includes up-to-date\n style for declarative animations. \n\n \n Tests\n \n\n

Faster reversing of interrupted transitions[](#reversing)\n \n \n Many common transitions effects involve transitions between two states,\n such as the transition that occurs when the mouse pointer moves\n over a user interface element, and then later moves out of that element.\n With these effects, it is common for a running transition\n to be interrupted before it completes,\n and the property reset to the starting value of that transition.\n An example is a hover effect on an element,\n where a transition starts when the pointer enters the element,\n and then the pointer exits the element before the effect has completed.\n If the outgoing and incoming transitions\n are executed using their specified durations and timing functions,\n the resulting effect can be distractingly asymmetric\n because the second transition\n takes the full specified time to move a shortened distance.\n Instead, this specification makes second transition shorter. \n\n \n The mechanism the above rules use to cause this involves the [reversing shortening factor](#transition-reversing-shortening-factor) and the [reversing-adjusted start value](#transition-reversing-adjusted-start-value).\n In particular, the reversing behavior is present whenever\n the reversing shortening factor is less than 1. \n\n \n Note that these rules do not fully address the problem for\n transition patterns that involve more than two states. \n\n \n Note that these rules lead to the entire timing function of the\n new transition being used, rather than jumping into the middle\n of a timing function, which can create a jarring effect. \n\n \n This was one of several possibilities that was considered by the\n working group. See the [reversing demo](examples/transition-reversing-demo) demonstrating a number of them, leading to a working group\n resolution made on 2013-06-07 and edits made on 2013-11-11.",
