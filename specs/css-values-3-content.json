      "content": "The **value definition syntax** described here\n is used to define the set of valid values for CSS properties\n (and the valid syntax of many other parts of CSS).\n A value so described can have one or more components.\n\n 2.1. Component Value Types[](#component-types)\n \nComponent value types are designated in several ways:\n\n \n\n \n \n[Keyword](#keywords) values (such as auto, [disc](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#disc), etc.),\nwhich appear literally, without quotes (e.g. auto).\n\n \n \nBasic data types,\nwhich appear between < and > (e.g., [<length>](#length-value), [<percentage>](#percentage-value), etc.).\nFor [numeric data types](#numeric-data-types),\nthis type notation can annotate any range restrictions\nusing the [bracketed range notation](#numeric-ranges) described below.\n\n \n \nProperty value ranges,\nwhich represent the same pattern of values as a property bearing the same name.\nThese are written as the property name,\nsurrounded by single quotes,\nbetween < and >,\ne.g., [<'border-width'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-width), [<'background-attachment'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-attachment), etc.\n\n \nThese types do not include [CSS-wide keywords](#common-keywords) such as [inherit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#valdef-all-inherit).\nAdditionally,\nif the property’s value grammar\nis a [comma-separated repetition](#mult-comma),\nthe corresponding type\ndoes not include the top-level comma-separated list multiplier.\n(E.g. if a property named pairing is defined as [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ]#,\nthen <'pairing'> is equivalent to [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ],\nnot [ [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) [<integer>](#integer-value)? ]#.)\\\n\n \n Why remove the multiplier?\n \nThe top-level multiplier is ripped out of these value types\n because top-level comma-separated repetitions are mostly used for [coordinating list properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#coordinating-list-property),\n and when a shorthand combines several such properties,\n it needs the unmultiplied grammar\n so it can construct its own comma-separated repetition.\n\n \nWithout this special treatment,\n every such longhand would have to be defined\n with an ad-hoc production just for the inner value,\n which makes the grammars harder to understand overall.\n\n \n \n \nFunctional notations and their arguments.\nThese are written as the function’s name,\nfollowed by an empty parentheses pair,\nbetween < and >,\ne.g. [<calc()>](#funcdef-calc),\nand references the correspondingly-named [functional notation](#functional-notation).\n\n \n \nOther non-terminals.\nThese are written as the name of the non-terminal\nbetween < and >,\nas in <spacing-limit>.\nNotice the distinction between [<border-width>](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#value-def-border-width) and [<'border-width'>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-width):\nthe latter represents the grammar of the border-width property,\nthe former requires an explicit expansion elsewhere.\nThe definition of a non-terminal is typically located near its first appearance in the specification.\n\n \n\n \nSome property value definitions also include the slash (/),\n the comma (,),\n and/or parentheses as literals.\n These represent their corresponding tokens.\n Other non-keyword literal characters that may appear in a component value,\n such as “+”,\n must be written enclosed in single quotes.\n\n \n**Commas** specified in the grammar are implicitly omissible in some circumstances,\n when used to separate optional terms in the grammar.\n Within a top-level list in a property or other CSS value,\n or a function’s argument list,\n a comma specified in the grammar must be omitted if:\n\n \n\n all items preceding the comma have been omitted \n all items following the comma have been omitted \n multiple commas would be adjacent (ignoring [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace)/comments),\n due to the items between the commas being omitted. \n \n\n \n [](#example-c02dd41d) For example, if a function can accept three arguments in order,\n but all of them are optional,\n the grammar can be written like: \n\n```\nexample( first[?](#mult-opt) [,](#comb-comma) second[?](#mult-opt) [,](#comb-comma) third[?](#mult-opt) )\n\n```\n\n \nGiven this grammar,\n writing example(first, second, third) is valid,\n as is example(first, second) or example(first, third) or example(second).\n However, example(first, , third) is invalid, as one of those commas are no longer separating two options;\n similarly, example(,second) and example(first,) are invalid. example(first second) is also invalid,\n as commas are still required to actually separate the options.\n\n \nIf commas were not implicitly omittable,\n the grammar would have to be much more complicated\n to properly express the ways that the arguments can be omitted,\n greatly obscuring the simplicity of the feature.\n\n \n \nAll CSS properties also accept the [CSS-wide keyword values](#common-keywords) as the sole component of their property value.\n For readability these are not listed explicitly in the property value syntax definitions.\n For example, the full value definition of [border-color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-border-color) under [CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3](#biblio-css-cascade-3) is <color>{1,4} | inherit | initial | unset (even though it is listed as <color>{1,4}).\n\n \nNote: This implies that, in general,\n combining these keywords with other component values in the same declaration\n results in an invalid declaration.\n For example, [background: url(corner.png) no-repeat, inherit;](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background) is invalid.\n\n 2.2. Component Value Combinators[](#component-combinators)\n \nComponent values can be arranged into property values as follows:\n\n \n\n Juxtaposing components means that\n all of them must occur, in the given order. \n A double ampersand (**&&**) separates two or more components,\n all of which must occur, in any order. \n A double bar (**||**) separates two or more options:\n one or more of them must occur, in any order. \n A bar (**|**) separates two or more alternatives:\n exactly one of them must occur. \n Brackets ([ ]) are for grouping. \n \n\n \nJuxtaposition is stronger than the double ampersand, the double\n ampersand is stronger than the double bar, and the double bar\n is stronger than the bar. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:\n\n```\n a b | c || d && e f\n[ a b ] | [ c || [ d && [ e f ]]]\n\n```\n\n \nFor reorderable combinators (||, &&),\n ordering of the grammar does not matter:\n components in the same grouping may be interleaved in any order.\n Thus, the following lines are equivalent:\n\n```\na || b || c\nb || a || c\n\n```\n\n \nNote: Combinators are not associative, so grouping is significant.\n For example, a || b || c and a || [ b || c ] are distinct grammars:\n the first allows a value like b a c, but the second does not.\n\n 2.3. Component Value Multipliers[](#component-multipliers)\n \nEvery type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of\n the following modifiers:\n\n \n\n An asterisk (*****)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs zero or more times. \n A plus (**+**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs one or more times. \n A question mark (**?**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n is optional (occurs zero or one times). \n A single number in curly braces ({A})\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs A times. \n A comma-separated pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B})\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs at least A and at most B times.\n The B may be omitted ({A,})\n to indicate that there must be at least A repetitions,\n with no upper bound on the number of repetitions. \n A hash mark (**#**)\n indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs one or more times, separated by comma tokens\n (which may optionally be surrounded by [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) and/or comments).\n It may optionally be followed by the curly brace forms, above,\n to indicate precisely how many times the repetition occurs,\n like <length>#{1,4}. \n An exclamation point (**!**) after a group\n indicates that the group is required\n and must produce at least one value;\n even if the grammar of the items within the group\n would otherwise allow the entire contents to be omitted,\n at least one component value must not be omitted. \n \n\n \nThe + and # multipliers may be stacked as +#;\n similarly, the # and ? multipliers may be stacked as #?.\n These stacks each represent the later multiplier\n applied to the result of the earlier multiplier.\n (These same stacks can be represented using grouping,\n but in complex grammars this can push the number of brackets beyond readability.)\n\n \nFor repeated component values (indicated by *, +, or #), [UAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) must support at least 20 repetitions of the component.\n If a property value contains more than the supported number of repetitions,\n the declaration must be ignored as if it were invalid.\n\n 2.4. Combinator and Multiplier Patterns[](#combinator-multiplier-patterns)\n \nThere are a small set of common ways to combine multiple independent [component values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#component-value) in particular numbers and orders.\n In particular, it’s common to want to express that,\n from a set of component value,\n the author must select zero or more, one or more, or all of them,\n and in either the order specified in the grammar or in any order.\n\n \nAll of these can be easily expressed using simple patterns of [combinators](#component-combinators) and [multipliers](#component-multipliers):\n\n \n \n \n \n in order \n any order \n \n \n zero or more \n A? B? C? \n A? || B? || C? \n \n one or more \n [ A? B? C? ]! \n A || B || C \n \n all \n A B C \n A && B && C \n \n \nNote that all of the \"any order\" possibilities are expressed using combinators,\n while the \"in order\" possibilities are all variants on juxtaposition.\n\n 2.5. Component Values and White Space[](#component-whitespace)\n \nUnless otherwise specified, [white space](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) and/or comments may appear before, after, and/or between\n components combined using the above [combinators](#component-combinators) and [multipliers](#component-multipliers).\n\n \nNote: In many cases, spaces will in fact be required between components\n in order to distinguish them from each other.\n For example, the value 1em2em would be parsed as a single [<dimension-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-dimension-token) with the number 1 and the identifier em2em,\n which is an invalid unit.\n In this case, a space would be required before the 2 to get this parsed as the two lengths 1em and 2em.\n\n 2.6.

      "content": "The **textual data types** include\n various keywords and identifiers\n as well as strings ([<string>](#string-value)) and URLs ([<url>](#url-value)).\n\n \nCSS **identifiers**,\n generically denoted by **<ident>**,\n consist of a sequence of characters conforming to the [<ident-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-ident-token) grammar. [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3) Identifiers cannot be quoted;\n otherwise they would be interpreted as strings.\n CSS properties accept two classes of [identifiers](#css-css-identifier): [pre-defined keywords](#keywords) and [author-defined identifiers](#custom-idents).\n\n \nNote: The [<ident>](#typedef-ident) production is not meant for property value definitions—​[<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) should be used instead.\n It is provided as a convenience for defining other syntactic constructs.\n\n 3.1. Pre-defined Keywords[](#keywords)\n \nIn the value definition fields, **keywords** with a pre-defined meaning appear literally.\n Keywords are [identifiers](#css-css-identifier) and are interpreted [ASCII case-insensitively](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive) (i.e., [a-z] and [A-Z] are equivalent).\n\n \n [](#example-9d0ae504) For example, here is the value definition for the [border-collapse](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#propdef-border-collapse) property: \n\n```\nValue: collapse | separate\n```\n\n \nAnd here is an example of its use:\n\n```\ntable { border-collapse: separate }\n```\n\n \n 3.1.1. CSS-wide keywords: [initial](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#valdef-all-initial), [inherit](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#valdef-all-inherit) and [unset](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#valdef-all-unset)[](#common-keywords)\n \nAs defined [above](#component-types),\n all properties accept the **CSS-wide keywords**,\n which represent value computations common to all CSS properties.\n These keywords are normatively defined in\n the [CSS Cascading and Inheritance Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#defaulting-keywords).\n\n \nOther CSS specifications can define additional CSS-wide keywords.\n\n 3.2. Author-defined Identifiers: the [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) type[](#custom-idents)\n \nSome properties accept arbitrary author-defined identifiers as a component value.\n This generic data type is denoted by **<custom-ident>**,\n and represents any valid [CSS identifier](#css-css-identifier) that would not be misinterpreted as a pre-defined keyword in that property’s value definition.\n Such identifiers are fully case-sensitive,\n even in the ASCII range\n (e.g. example and EXAMPLE are two different, unrelated user-defined identifiers).\n\n \nThe [CSS-wide keywords](#css-wide-keywords) are not valid [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value)s.\n The default keyword is reserved\n and is also not a valid <custom-ident>.\n Specifications using <custom-ident> must specify clearly\n what other keywords are excluded from <custom-ident>, if any—​for example by saying that any pre-defined keywords in that property’s value definition are excluded.\n Excluded keywords are excluded in all [ASCII case permutations](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive).\n\n \nWhen parsing positionally-ambiguous keywords in a property value,\n a [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) production can only claim the keyword if no other unfulfilled production can claim it.\n\n [](#example-950e3618) For example, the shorthand declaration [animation: ease-in ease-out](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation) is equivalent to the longhand declarations [animation-timing-function: ease-in; animation-name: ease-out;](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation-timing-function). [ease-in](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-in) is claimed by the [<easing-function>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#typedef-easing-function) production belonging to animation-timing-function,\n leaving [ease-out](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-out) to be claimed by the [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value) production belonging to [animation-name](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations-1/#propdef-animation-name). \n \nNote: When designing grammars with [<custom-ident>](#identifier-value),\n the <custom-ident> should always be “positionally unambiguous”,\n so that it’s impossible to conflict with any keyword values in the property.\n\n 3.3. Quoted Strings: the [<string>](#string-value) type[](#strings)\n \n[Strings](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string) are denoted by **<string>**.\n When written literally,\n they consist of a sequence of characters delimited by double quotes or single quotes,\n corresponding to the [<string-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-string-token) production\n in the [CSS Syntax Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n\n \n [](#example-9204e1e4) Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, unless [escaped](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#escaped-characters) (as \"\\\"\" or as \"\\22\").\n Analogously for single quotes ('\\'' or '\\27'). \n\n```\ncontent: \"this is a 'string'.\";\ncontent: \"this is a \\\"string\\\".\";\ncontent: 'this is a \"string\".';\ncontent: 'this is a \\'string\\'.'\n\n```\n\n \n \nIt is possible to break strings over several lines, for aesthetic or\n other reasons, but in such a case the newline itself has to be escaped\n with a backslash (\\). The newline is subsequently removed from the\n string. For instance, the following two selectors are exactly the\n same:\n\n \n [](#example-4f7429ed) \n \nExample(s): \n\n```\na[title=\"a not s\\\no very long title\"] {/*...*/}\na[title=\"a not so very long title\"] {/*...*/}\n\n```\n\n \n \nSince a string cannot directly represent a newline, to include a\n newline in a string, use the escape \"\\A\". (Hexadecimal A is the line\n feed character in Unicode (U+000A), but represents the generic notion\n of \"newline\" in CSS.)\n\n 3.4. Resource Locators: the [<url>](#url-value) type[](#urls)\n \nThe **url()** [functional notation](#functional-notation),\n denoted by [<url>](#url-value),\n represents a **URL**,\n which is a pointer to a resource.\n The typical syntax of a <url> is:\n\n```\n**<url>** = url( [<string>](#string-value) [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)[*](#mult-zero-plus) )\n\n```\n\n \n [](#example-1dcaf1ec) This example shows a URL being used as a background image: \n\n```\nbody { background: url(\"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\") }\n\n```\n\n \n \nA [url()](#funcdef-url) can alternatively be written be written without quotation marks around the URL value,\n in which case it is [specially-parsed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-a-url-token) as a [<url-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-url-token); see [CSS Syntax 3 § 4.3.6 Consume a url token](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-url-token). [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3)\n\n \n [](#example-2e04cf61) For example, the following declarations are identical: \n\n```\nbackground: url(\"http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif\");\nbackground: url(http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif);\n\n```\n\n \n \nNote: The unquoted [url()](#funcdef-url) syntax cannot accept a [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier) argument\n and has extra escaping requirements:\n parentheses, [whitespace](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace) characters,\n single quotes (') and double quotes (\") appearing in a URL\n must be escaped with a backslash,\n e.g. url(open\\(parens), url(close\\)parens).\n (In quoted [<string>](#string-value) url()s,\n only newlines and the character used to quote the string need to be escaped.)\n Depending on the type of URL,\n it might also be possible to write these characters as URL-escapes\n (e.g. url(open%28parens) or url(close%29parens))\n as described in [[URL]](#biblio-url).\n\n \nSome CSS contexts (such as [@import](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#at-ruledef-import)) also allow a [<url>](#url-value) to be represented by a bare [<string>](#string-value), without the function wrapper.\n In such cases the string behaves identically to a [url()](#funcdef-url) function containing that string.\n\n \n [](#example-ae720903) For example, the following statements act identically: \n\n```\n@import url(\"base-theme.css\");\n@import \"base-theme.css\";\n\n```\n\n \n 3.4.1. Relative URLs[](#relative-urls)\n \nIn order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on\n the absolute location of a resource, authors should use relative URLs.\n Relative URLs (as defined in [[URL]](#biblio-url)) are resolved to full URLs\n using a base URL. RFC 3986, section 3, defines the normative\n algorithm for this process.\n For CSS style sheets, the base URL is that of the style sheet itself,\n not that of the styled source document.\n Style sheets embedded within a document have\n the base URL associated with their container.\n\n \nNote: For HTML documents,\n the [base URL is mutable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls).\n\n \nWhen a [<url>](#url-value) appears in the computed value of a property,\n it is resolved to an absolute URL,\n as described in the preceding paragraph.\n The computed value of a URL that the [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) cannot resolve to an absolute URL is the specified value.\n\n \n [](#example-b514611a) For example, suppose the following rule: \n\n```\nbody { background: url(\"tile.png\") }\n```\n\n \nis located in a style sheet designated by the URL:\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.org/style/basic.css\n```\n\n \nThe background of the source document’s <body> will be tiled with whatever image is described by the resource designated by the URL:\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.org/style/tile.png\n```\n\n \nThe same image will be used regardless of the URL of the source document containing the <body>.\n\n \n 3.4.1.1. Fragment URLs[](#local-urls)\n \nTo work around some common eccentricities in browser URL handling,\n CSS has special behavior for fragment-only urls.\n\n \nIf a [url()](#funcdef-url)’s value starts with a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#) character,\n parse it as per normal for URLs,\n but additionally set the **local url flag** of the url().\n\n \nWhen matching a [url()](#funcdef-url) with the [local url flag](#url-local-url-flag) set,\n ignore everything but the URL’s fragment,\n and resolve that fragment against the current document that relative URLs are resolved against.\n This reference must always be treated as same-document\n (rather than cross-document).\n\n \nWhen [serializing](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values) a [url()](#funcdef-url) with the [local url flag](#url-local-url-flag) set,\n it must serialize as just the fragment.\n\n \n What “browser eccentricities”?\n \nTheoretically, browsers should re-resolve any relative URLs,\n including fragment-only URLs,\n whenever the document’s base URL changes\n (such as through mutation of the [base](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-base-element) element,\n or calling [pushState()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#dom-history-pushstate)).\n In many cases they don’t, however,\n and so without special handling,\n fragment-only URLs will suddenly become cross-document references\n (pointing at the previous base URL)\n and break in many of the places they’re used.\n\n \nSince fragment-only URLs express a clear semantic\n of wanting to refer to the current document\n regardless of what its current URL is,\n this hack preserves the expected behavior at least in these cases.\n\n \n 3.4.2. Empty URLs[](#url-empty)\n \nIf the value of the [<url>](#url-value) is the empty string\n (like url(\"\") or [url()](#funcdef-url)),\n the url must resolve to an invalid resource\n (similar to what the url about:invalid does).\n\n \nIts computed value is url(\"\"),\n and it must serialize as such.\n\n \nNote: This matches the behavior of empty urls for embedded resources elsewhere in the web platform,\n and avoids excess traffic re-requesting the stylesheet or host document\n due to editing mistakes leaving the [url()](#funcdef-url) value empty,\n which are almost certain to be invalid resources for whatever the url() shows up in.\n Linking on the web platform does allow empty urls,\n so if/when CSS gains some functionality to control hyperlinks,\n this restriction can be relaxed in those contexts.\n\n 3.4.3. URL Modifiers[](#url-modifiers)\n \nThe [url()](#funcdef-url) function supports specifying additional **<url-modifier>**s,\n which change the meaning or the interpretation of the URL somehow.\n A [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier) is either an [<ident>](#typedef-ident) or a [functional notation](#functional-notation).\n\n \nThis specification does not define any [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)s,\n but other specs may do so.\n\n \nNote: A [<url>](#url-value) that is either unquoted or not wrapped in [url()](#funcdef-url) notation\n cannot accept any [<url-modifier>](#typedef-url-modifier)s.",

      "content": "Numeric data types are used to represent\n quantities, indexes, positions, and other such values.\n Although many syntactic variations can exist\n in expressing the quantity (numeric aspect) in a given numeric value,\n the [specified](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value) and [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) do not distinguish these variations:\n they represent the value’s abstract quantity,\n not its syntactic representation.\n\n \nThe **numeric data types** include [<integer>](#integer-value), [<number>](#number-value), [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n and various [dimensions](#dimension) including [<length>](#length-value), [<angle>](#angle-value), [<time>](#time-value), [<frequency>](#frequency-value), and [<resolution>](#resolution-value).\n\n \nNote: While general-purpose [dimensions](#dimension) are defined here,\n some other modules define additional data types\n (e.g. [[css-grid-1]](#biblio-css-grid-1) introduces [fr](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#valdef-flex-fr) units)\n whose usage is more localized.\n\n 4.1. Range Restrictions and Range Definition Notation[](#numeric-ranges)\n \nProperties can restrict numeric values to some range.\n If the value is outside the allowed range,\n then unless otherwise specified,\n the declaration is invalid and must be [ignored](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore).\n Range restrictions can be annotated in the numeric type notation\n using **CSS bracketed range notation**—​[min,max]—​within the angle brackets, after the identifying keyword,\n indicating a closed range\n between (and including) min and max.\n For example, [<integer [0,10]>](#integer-value) indicates an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive,\n while [<angle [0,180deg]>](#angle-value) indicates an angle between 0deg and 180deg (expressed in any unit).\n\n \nNote: CSS values generally do not allow open ranges;\n thus only square-bracket notation is used.\n\n \nCSS theoretically supports infinite precision and infinite ranges for all value types;\n however in reality implementations have finite capacity. [UAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) should support reasonably useful ranges and precisions.\n Range extremes that are ideally unlimited\n are indicated using ∞ or −∞ as appropriate.\n For example, [<length [0,∞]>](#length-value) indicates a non-negative length.\n\n \nIf no range is indicated,\n either by using the [bracketed range notation](#css-bracketed-range-notation) or in the property description,\n then [−∞,∞] is assumed.\n\n \nValues of −∞ or ∞ must be written without units,\n even if the value type uses units.\n Values of 0 can be written without units,\n even if the value type doesn’t allow “unitless zeroes”\n (such as [<time>](#time-value)).\n\n \nNote: At the time of writing,\n the [bracketed range notation](#css-bracketed-range-notation) is new;\n thus in most CSS specifications\n any range limitations are described only in prose.\n (For example, “Negative values are not allowed” or\n “Negative values are invalid”\n indicate a [0,∞] range.)\n This does not make them any less binding.\n\n 4.2. Integers: the [<integer>](#integer-value) type[](#integers)\n \nInteger values are denoted by **<integer>**.\n\n \nWhen written literally,\n an **integer** is one or more decimal digits 0 through 9 and corresponds to a subset of the [<number-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-number-token) production\n in the CSS Syntax Module [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n The first digit of an integer may be immediately preceded by - or + to indicate the integer’s sign.\n\n 4.3. Real Numbers: the [<number>](#number-value) type[](#numbers)\n \nNumber values are denoted by **<number>**,\n and represent real numbers, possibly with a fractional component.\n\n \nWhen written literally,\n a **number** is either an [integer](#integer),\n or zero or more decimal digits followed by a dot (.) followed by one or more decimal digits;\n optionally, it can be concluded by the letter “e” or “E”\n followed by an integer indicating the base-ten exponent\n in [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation).\n It corresponds to the [<number-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-number-token) production\n in the [CSS Syntax Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n As with integers, the first character of a number\n may be immediately preceded by - or + to indicate the number’s sign.\n\n 4.4. Numbers with Units: [dimension](#dimension) values[](#dimensions)\n \nThe general term **dimension** refers to\n a number with a unit attached to it;\n and is denoted by **<dimension>**.\n\n \nWhen written literally,\n a [dimension](#dimension) is a [number](#number) immediately followed by a unit identifier,\n which is an [identifier](#css-css-identifier).\n It corresponds to the [<dimension-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-dimension-token) production\n in the [CSS Syntax Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n Like keywords, unit identifiers are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive).\n\n \nCSS uses [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension)s to specify\n distances ([<length>](#length-value)),\n durations ([<time>](#time-value)),\n frequencies ([<frequency>](#frequency-value)),\n resolutions ([<resolution>](#resolution-value)),\n and other quantities.\n\n 4.4.1. Compatible Units[](#compat)\n \nWhen [serializing](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values) [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) [[CSSOM]](#biblio-cssom), **compatible units** (those related by a static multiplicative factor,\n like the 96:1 factor between [px](#px) and [in](#in),\n or the computed [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) factor between [em](#em) and px)\n are converted into a single **canonical unit**.\n Each group of compatible units defines which among them is the [canonical unit](#canonical-unit) that will be used for serialization.\n\n \nWhen serializing [resolved values](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#resolved-values) that are [used values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value),\n all value types (percentages, numbers, keywords, etc.)\n that represent lengths are considered [compatible](#compatible-units) with lengths.\n Likewise any future API that returns used values must consider any values that represent distances/durations/frequencies/etc.\n as compatible with the relevant class of [dimensions](#dimension),\n and canonicalize accordingly.\n\n 4.5. Percentages: the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) type[](#percentages)\n \nPercentage values are denoted by **<percentage>**,\n and indicates a value that is some fraction of another reference value.\n\n \nWhen written literally,\n a **percentage** consists of a [number](#number) immediately followed by a percent sign %.\n It corresponds to the [<percentage-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-percentage-token) production\n in the [CSS Syntax Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/) [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]](#biblio-css-syntax-3).\n\n \nPercentage values are always relative to another quantity,\n for example a length.\n Each property that allows percentages also defines the quantity to which the percentage refers.\n This quantity can be a value of another property for the same element,\n the value of a property for an ancestor element,\n a measurement of the formatting context\n (e.g., the width of a [containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#containing-block)),\n or something else.\n\n 4.6. Mixing Percentages and Dimensions[](#mixed-percentages)\n \nIn cases where a [<percentage>](#percentage-value) can represent the same quantity\n as a [dimension](#dimension) in the same [component value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#component-value) position,\n and can therefore be combined with them in a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) expression,\n the following convenience notations may be used in the property grammar:\n\n \n **<length-percentage>**\n \n \nEquivalent to [ [<length>](#length-value) [|](#comb-one) [<percentage>](#percentage-value) ],\nwhere the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) will resolve to a [<length>](#length-value).\n\n **<frequency-percentage>**\n \n \nEquivalent to [ [<frequency>](#frequency-value) [|](#comb-one) [<percentage>](#percentage-value) ],\nwhere the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) will resolve to a [<frequency>](#frequency-value).\n\n **<angle-percentage>**\n \n \nEquivalent to [ [<angle>](#angle-value) [|](#comb-one) [<percentage>](#percentage-value) ],\nwhere the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) will resolve to an [<angle>](#angle-value).\n\n **<time-percentage>**\n \n \nEquivalent to [ [<time>](#time-value) [|](#comb-one) [<percentage>](#percentage-value) ],\nwhere the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) will resolve to a [<time>](#time-value).\n\n \n \n [](#example-10c2940e) For example, the [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) property can accept a [<length>](#length-value) or a [<percentage>](#percentage-value),\n both representing a measure of distance.\n This means that width: calc(500px + 50%); is allowed—​both values are converted to absolute lengths and added.\n If the containing block is 1000px wide,\n then width: 50%; is equivalent to width: 500px,\n and width: calc(50% + 500px) thus ends up equivalent to width: calc(500px + 500px) or width: 1000px. \n \nOn the other hand, the second and third arguments of the [hsl()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#funcdef-hsl) function\n can only be expressed as [<percentage>](#percentage-value)s.\n Although [calc()](#funcdef-calc) productions are allowed in their place,\n they can only combine percentages with themselves,\n as in calc(10% + 20%).\n\n \n \nNote: Specifications should never alternate [<percentage>](#percentage-value) in place of a dimension\n in a grammar unless they are [compatible](#compatible-units).\n\n \nNote: More <type-percentage> productions can be added in the future as needed.\n A <number-percentage> will never be added,\n as [<number>](#number-value) and [<percentage>](#percentage-value) can’t be combined in [calc()](#funcdef-calc).",

Lengths in publishing contexts\n are sometimes written like 2p3,\n indicating a length of 2 picas and 3 points.\n These can be written in CSS as calc(2pc + 3pt) (see [§ 8.1 Mathematical Expressions: calc()](#calc-notation)).\n\n \nAll of the absolute length units are [compatible](#compatible-units),\n and [px](#px) is their [canonical unit](#canonical-unit).\n\n \nFor a CSS device, these dimensions are **anchored** either\n\n \n\n by relating the [physical units](#physical-unit) to their physical measurements, or \n by relating the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit) to the [reference pixel](#reference-pixel). \n \n\n \nFor print media at typical viewing distances,\n the [anchor unit](#anchor-unit) should be one of the [physical units](#physical-unit) (inches, centimeters, etc).\n For screen media (including high-resolution devices),\n low-resolution devices,\n and devices with unusual viewing distances,\n it is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit).\n For such devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of [device pixels](#device-pixel) that best approximates the reference pixel.\n\n \nNote: If the [anchor unit](#anchor-unit) is the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit),\n the [physical units](#physical-unit) might not match their physical measurements.\n Alternatively if the anchor unit is a physical unit,\n the pixel unit might not map to a whole number of [device pixels](#device-pixel).\n\n \nNote: This definition of the [pixel unit](#visual-angle-unit) and the [physical units](#physical-unit) differs from the earlier editions of CSS1 and CSS2.\n In particular, in previous versions of CSS the pixel unit and the physical units were not related by a fixed ratio:\n the physical units were always tied to their physical measurements\n while the pixel unit would vary to most closely match the reference pixel.\n (This unfortunate change\n was made because too much existing content relies on the assumption of 96dpi,\n and breaking that assumption broke the content.)\n\n \nNote: Units are [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive) and serialize as lowercase, for example 1Q serializes as 1q.\n\n \nThe **reference pixel** is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a [device pixel](#device-pixel) density of 96dpi\n and a distance from the reader of an arm’s length.\n For a nominal arm’s length of 28 inches,\n the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees.\n For reading at arm’s length,\n 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).\n\n \nThe image below illustrates the effect of viewing distance on the size of a reference pixel:\n a reading distance of 71 cm (28 inches)\n results in a reference pixel of 0.26 mm,\n while a reading distance of 3.5 m (12 feet)\n results in a reference pixel of 1.3 mm.\n\n \n \n Showing that pixels must become larger if the viewing distance increases \n \n \nThis second image illustrates the effect of a device’s resolution on the pixel unit:\n an area of 1px by 1px is covered by a single dot in a low-resolution device\n (e.g. a typical computer display),\n while the same area is covered by 16 dots in a higher resolution device\n (such as a printer).\n\n \n \n Showing that more device pixels (dots) are needed\n to cover a 1px by 1px area on a high-resolution device\n than on a lower-resolution one\n (of the same approximate viewing distance) \n \n \nA **device pixel** is the smallest unit of area on the device output\n capable of displaying its full range of colors.\n For typical color screens, it’s a square or somewhat rectangular region\n containing a red, green, and blue subpixel.\n Many non-traditional outputs exist that can blur this definition,\n such as by displaying some colors at higher resolutions.\n Such devices still expose some equivalent notion of \"device pixel\",\n

Type Checking[](#calc-type-checking)\n \nA math expression has a **resolved type**, which is one of [<length>](#length-value), [<frequency>](#frequency-value), [<angle>](#angle-value), [<time>](#time-value), [<percentage>](#percentage-value), [<number>](#number-value), or [<integer>](#integer-value).\n The [resolved type](#resolved-type) must be valid for where the expression is placed;\n otherwise, the expression is invalid.\n The resolved type of the expression is determined by the types of the values it contains. [<number-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-number-token)s are of type <number> or <integer>.\n A [<dimension-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-dimension-token)’s type is given by its unit\n ([cm](#cm) is <length>, [deg](#deg) is <angle>, etc.).\n\n \nNote: Because [<number-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-number-token)s are always interpreted as [<number>](#number-value)s or [<integer>](#integer-value)s,\n \"unitless 0\" [<length>](#length-value)s aren’t supported in [calc()](#funcdef-calc).\n That is, [width: calc(0 + 5px);](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) is invalid,\n even though both width: 0; and width: 5px; are valid.\n\n \nIf percentages are accepted in the context in which the expression is placed,\n and they are defined to be relative to another type besides [<number>](#number-value),\n a [<percentage-token>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-percentage-token) is treated as that type.\n For example, in the [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) property, percentages have the [<length>](#length-value) type.\n A percentage only has the [<percentage>](#percentage-value) type if in that context <percentage> values are not used-value compatible with any other type.\n If percentages are not normally allowed in place of the [calc()](#funcdef-calc),\n then a calc() expression containing percentages is invalid in that context.\n\n \nNote: Note that [<percentage>](#percentage-value)s relative to [<number>](#number-value)s,\n such as in [opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-opacity),\n are not allowed in [calc()](#funcdef-calc).\n Allowing this would cause significant problems with \"unit algebra\"\n (allowing multiplication/division of [<dimension>](#typedef-dimension)s),\n and in every case so far,\n doesn’t provide any new functionality.\n (For example, opacity: 25% is identical to opacity: .25;\n it’s just a trivial syntax transform.)\n\n \nNote: Although there are a few properties in which a bare [<number>](#number-value) becomes a [<length>](#length-value) at used-value time\n (specifically, [line-height](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-line-height) and [tab-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#propdef-tab-size)), <number>s never become \"length-like\" in [calc()](#funcdef-calc).\n They always stay as <number>s.\n\n \nOperators form sub-expressions, which gain types based on their arguments.\n To make expressions simpler,\n operators have restrictions on the types they accept.\n At each operator,\n the types of the left and right argument are checked for these restrictions.\n If compatible, the type resolves as described below\n (the following ignores precedence rules on the operators for simplicity):\n\n \n\n At [+](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#selectordef-adjacent) or -,\n check that both sides have the same type,\n or that one side is a [<number>](#number-value) and the other is an [<integer>](#integer-value).\n If both sides are the same type,\n resolve to that type.\n If one side is a <number> and the other is an <integer>,\n resolve to <number>. \n At [*](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#x),\n check that at least one side is [<number>](#number-value).\n If both sides are [<integer>](#integer-value),\n resolve to <integer>.\n Otherwise,\n resolve to the type of the other side. \n At /,\n check that the right side is [<number>](#number-value).\n If the left side is [<integer>](#integer-value),\n resolve to <number>.\n Otherwise,\n resolve to the type of the left side. \n \n\n \nIf an operator does not pass the above checks, the expression is invalid.\n Also, division by zero is invalid. This includes both dividing by the\n literal number zero, as well as any numeric expression that evaluates to zero\n (as purely-numeric expressions can be evaluated without any additional\n information at parse time).\n\n \nNote: Algebraic simplifications do not affect the validity of the [calc()](#funcdef-calc) expression or its resolved type.\n For example, calc(5px - 5px + 10s) and calc(0 * 5px + 10s) are both invalid\n due to the attempt to add a length and a time.\n\n 8.1.3. Computed Value[](#calc-computed-value)\n \nThe computed value of a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) expression is the expression\n with all components computed.\n\n \nWhere percentages are not resolved at computed-value time,\n they are not resolved in [calc()](#funcdef-calc) expressions,\n e.g. calc(100% - 100% + 1em) resolves to calc(1em + 0%),\n not to 1em.\n If there are special rules for computing percentages in a value\n (e.g. [the height property](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-property)),\n they apply whenever a calc() expression contains percentages.\n\n \n [](#example-023dad93) For example,\n whereas [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) computes percentage values at [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) time\n so that [font-relative length](#font-relative-length) units can be computed, [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) has layout-dependent behavior for percentage values,\n and thus does not resolve percentages until used-value time. \n \nDue to this, [background-position](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-position) computation preserves the percentage in a [calc()](#funcdef-calc) whereas [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size) will compute such expressions directly into a length.\n\n \n \nGiven the complexities of width and height calculations on table cells and table elements,\n math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on\n table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells\n in both auto and fixed layout tables\n MAY be treated as if [auto](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-auto) had been specified.\n\n 8.1.4. Range Checking[](#calc-range)\n \nParse-time range-checking of values is not performed within [calc()](#funcdef-calc),\n and therefore out-of-range values do not cause the declaration to become invalid.\n However, the value resulting from an expression\n must be clamped to the range allowed in the target context.\n Clamping is performed on [computed values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) to the extent possible,\n and also on [used values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) if computation was unable to sufficiently simplify the expression\n to allow range-checking.\n (Clamping is not performed on [specified values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#specified-value).)\n\n \nNote: This requires all contexts accepting [calc()](#funcdef-calc) to define their allowable values as a closed (not open) interval.\n\n \n [](#example-ec14dee2) Since widths smaller than 0px are not allowed,\n these three declarations are equivalent: \n\n```\nwidth: calc(5px - 10px);\nwidth: calc(-5px);\nwidth: 0px;\n\n```\n\n \nNote however that [width: -5px](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-width) is not equivalent to width: calc(-5px)!\n Out-of-range values outside [calc()](#funcdef-calc) are syntactically invalid,\n and cause the entire declaration to be dropped.\n\n \n 8.1.5.
