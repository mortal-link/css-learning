Module Interactions[](#placement)\n \nThis module replaces and extends the background and border features\n defined in [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) sections 8.5 and 14.2.\n\n \nAll properties in this module apply to the [::first-letter](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#first-letter0) [pseudo-element](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#pseudo-element).\n The [background properties](#backgrounds) and [border-radius properties](#corners) also apply\n to the [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#sel-first-line) pseudo-element.\n The UA may (but is not required to)\n apply the [border-image](#propdef-border-image) or [box-shadow](#propdef-box-shadow) properties to ::first-line.\n The UA must not\n apply the [border-color/style/width properties](#borders) to ::first-line. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)\n\n 1.2. Value Definitions[](#values)\n \nThis specification follows the [CSS property definition conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) using the [value definition syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs) from [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [CSS-VALUES-3].\n Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.\n For example, combining with [CSS Images](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images/) allows for using CSS gradients as [background-image](#propdef-background-image) or [border-image](#propdef-border-image) values. [[CSS-IMAGES-3]](#biblio-css-images-3)\n\n \nIn addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,\n all properties defined in this specification\n also accept the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) as their property value.\n For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.",

      "content": "Each box has a background layer that may be fully transparent (the default),\n or filled with a color and/or one or more images.\n The background properties specify what color ([background-color](#propdef-background-color))\n and images ([background-image](#propdef-background-image)) to use,\n and how they are sized, positioned, tiled, etc.\n\n \nThe background properties are not inherited,\n but the parent box’s background will shine through by default\n because of the initial [transparent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-transparent) value on [background-color](#propdef-background-color).\n\n 2.1. Layering Multiple Background Images[](#layering)\n \nThe background of a box can have multiple **background image layers**.\n The number of layers is determined by\n the number of comma-separated values in the [background-image](#propdef-background-image) property.\n Note that a value of [none](#valdef-background-image-none) still creates a layer.\n\n \nEach of the [background images](#background-images) is sized, positioned, and tiled\n according to the corresponding value in the other background properties.\n The lists are matched up from the first value:\n excess values at the end are not used.\n If a property doesn’t have enough comma-separated values\n to match the number of layers,\n the [UA](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#user-agent) must calculate its [used value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) by repeating the list of values until there are enough.\n\n \n [](#example-bef8b176) For example, this set of declarations: \n\n```\nbackground-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass.png);\nbackground-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left, bottom right;\nbackground-origin: border-box, content-box;\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\n\n```\n\n \nhas exactly the same effect as this set,\n with the extra position dropped\n and the missing values for [background-origin](#propdef-background-origin) and [background-repeat](#propdef-background-repeat) filled in (emphasized for clarity):\n\n```\nbackground-image: url(flower.png), url(ball.png), url(grass.png);\nbackground-position: center center, 20% 80%, top left;\nbackground-origin: border-box, content-box, border-box;\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat, no-repeat;\n\n```\n\n \n \nThe first image in the list is the [layer](#background-image-layer) closest to the user,\n the next one is painted behind the first, and so on.\n The background color, if present,\n is painted below all of the other layers.\n\n \nNote: The [border-image properties](#border-images) can also define a background image,\n which, if present, is painted on top of\n the background [layers](#background-image-layer) created by the background properties.\n\n 2.2.

/* default */\nbackground-image: url(flower.png) }\n\n```\n\n \nThe following example rounds the height of the image to 33.3%,\n up from the specified value of 30%.\n At 30%, three images would fit entirely and a fourth only partially.\n After rounding, three images fit exactly.\n The width of the image is 20% of the background positioning area width\n and is not rounded.\n\n```\np {\n background-image: url(chain.png);\n background-repeat: no-repeat round;\n background-size: 20% 30% }\n\n```\n\n \n \nIf [background-repeat](#propdef-background-repeat) is [round](#valdef-background-repeat-round) for one (or both) dimensions,\n there is a second step.\n The UA must scale the image in that dimension (or both dimensions)\n so that it fits a whole number of times in the [background positioning area](#background-positioning-area).\n In the case of the width (height is analogous):\n\n If X ≠ 0 is the width of the image after step one\n and W is the width of the background positioning area,\n then the rounded width X' = W / round(W / X)\n where round() is a function that returns the nearest natural number\n (integer greater than zero). \n \nIf [background-repeat](#propdef-background-repeat) is [round](#valdef-background-repeat-round) for one dimension only\n and if [background-size](#propdef-background-size) is [auto](#valdef-background-size-auto) for the other dimension,\n then there is a third step:\n that other dimension is scaled so that the original aspect ratio is restored.\n\n \n [](#example-a61fb097) In this example the background image is shown at its natural size: \n\n```\ndiv {\n background-image: url(image1.png);\n background-repeat: repeat; /* default */\n background-size: auto } /* default */\n\n```\n\n \nIn the following example, the background is shown with a width of\n 3em and its height is scaled proportionally to keep the original\n aspect ratio:\n\n```\ndiv {\n background-image: url(image2.png);\n background-repeat: repeat; /* default */\n background-size: 3em } /* = '3em auto' */\n\n```\n\n \nIn the following example,\n the background is shown with a width of approximately 3em:\n scaled so that it fits a whole number of times in the width of the background.\n The height is scaled proportionally to keep the original aspect ratio:\n\n```\ndiv {\n background-image: url(image3.png);\n background-repeat: round repeat;\n background-size: 3em auto }\n\n```\n\n \nIn the following example, the background image is shown\n with a width of 3em and a height that is either\n the height corresponding to that width at the original aspect ratio\n or slightly less:\n\n```\ndiv {\n background-image: url(image4.png);\n background-repeat: repeat round;\n background-size: 3em auto }\n\n```\n\n \nIn the following example,\n the background image is shown with a height of approximately 4em:\n scaled slightly so that it fits a whole number of times in the background height.\n The width is the approximately the width that corresponds to\n a 4em height at the original aspect ratio:\n scaled slightly so that it fits a whole number of times\n in the background width.\n\n```\ndiv {\n background-image: url(image5.png);\n background-repeat: round;\n background-size: auto 4em }\n\n```\n\n \n \nIf the background image’s width or height resolves to zero,\n this causes the image not to be displayed.\n (The effect is the same as if it had been a transparent image.)\n\n \nSee [§ 2.1 Layering Multiple Background Images](#layering) for how [background-size](#propdef-background-size) interacts\n with other comma-separated background properties\n to form each [background image layer](#background-image-layer).\n\n 2.10.

Backgrounds of Special Elements[](#special-backgrounds)\n \nThe document [canvas](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/intro.html#the-canvas) is the infinite surface over which the document is rendered. [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) Since no element corresponds to the canvas,\n in order to allow styling of the canvas\n CSS propagates the background of the [root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#root-element) (or, in the case of HTML, the <body> element)\n as described below.\n However, if the element whose background would be used for the canvas\n is [display: none](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-display),\n then the [canvas background](#canvas-background) is transparent.\n\n \nIf the [canvas background](#canvas-background) is not opaque,\n the **canvas surface** below it shows through.\n The texture of the [canvas surface](#canvas-surface) is UA-dependent\n (but is typically an opaque white).\n\n 2.11.1. The Canvas Background and the Root Element[](#root-background)\n \nThe background of the [root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#root-element) becomes the **canvas background** and its [background painting area](#background-painting-area) extends\n to cover the entire [canvas](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/intro.html#the-canvas).\n However, any images are sized and positioned relative to the root element’s box\n as if they were painted for that element alone.\n (In other words, the [background positioning area](#background-positioning-area) is determined as for the root element.)\n The root element does not paint this background again,\n i.e., the [used value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) of its background is [transparent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-transparent).\n\n 2.11.2. The Canvas Background and the HTML <body> Element[](#body-background)\n \nFor documents whose root element is\n an HTML HTML element\n or an XHTML html element [[HTML]](#biblio-html):\n if the [computed value](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#computed-value) of [background-image](#propdef-background-image) on the [root element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#root-element) is [none](#valdef-background-image-none) and its [background-color](#propdef-background-color) is [transparent](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-transparent),\n user agents must instead propagate\n the computed values of the background properties\n from that element’s first\n HTML BODY or XHTML body child element.\n The [used values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#used-value) of that BODY element’s background properties\n are their [initial values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#initial-value),\n and the propagated values are treated\n as if they were specified on the root element.\n It is recommended that authors of HTML documents specify the canvas background\n using the BODY element\n rather than the HTML element.\n\n \nNote: Using [containment](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-2/#containment) disables\n this special handling of the HTML `[body](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-body-element)` element.\n See the [CSS Containment 1 § 2 Strong Containment: the contain property](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-1/#contain-property) for details.\n\n \n [](#example-8733c37a) According to these rules, the canvas underlying the following HTML document\n will have a “marble” background: \n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN'\n >\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Setting the canvas background</title>\n <style type=\"text/css\">\n body { background: url(\"http://example.org/marble.png\") }\n </style>\n </head>\n <body>\n <p>My background is marble.</p>\n </body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n \n 2.11.3. The [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#sel-first-line) Pseudo-element‘s Background[](#first-line-background)\n \nThe [::first-line](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#sel-first-line) pseudo-element\n is like an inline-level element\n for the purposes of the background\n (see section 5.12.1 of [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2)).\n That means, e.g., that in a left-justified first line,\n the background does not necessarily extend\n all the way to the right edge.",

order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n see individual properties \n \n \nThe [border](#propdef-border) property is a [shorthand property](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#shorthand-property) for setting\n the same [border-width](#propdef-border-width), [border-color](#propdef-border-color), and [border-style](#propdef-border-style) for all four borders of a box.\n Unlike the shorthand [margin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-margin) and [padding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#propdef-padding) properties,\n the border property cannot set different values on the four borders.\n To do so, one or more of the other border properties must be used.\n\n \nThe [border](#propdef-border) shorthand also resets [border-image](#propdef-border-image) to its initial value.\n It is therefore recommended that authors use the border shorthand,\n rather than other shorthands or the individual properties,\n to override any border settings earlier in the cascade.\n This will ensure that border-image has also been reset\n to allow the new styles to take effect.\n\n \nNote: The CSS Working Group intends for the [border](#propdef-border) shorthand\n to reset all border properties in future levels of CSS as well.\n For example, if a border-characters property\n is introduced in the future to allow glyphs as borders,\n it will also be reset by the border shorthand.\n By using the border shorthand to reset borders,\n authors can be guaranteed a “blank canvas”\n no matter what properties are introduced in the future.\n\n \n [](#example-e8ed94e0) For example, the first rule below is equivalent to the set of five\n rules shown after it: \n\n```\np { border: solid red }\np {\n border-top: solid red;\n border-right: solid red;\n border-bottom: solid red;\n border-left: solid red;\n border-image: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \nSince, to some extent, the properties have overlapping functionality,\n the order in which the rules are specified is important.\n\n \n [](#example-10fca894) Consider this example: \n\n```\nblockquote {\n border-color: red;\n border-left: double;\n color: black\n}\n\n```\n\n \nIn the above example,\n the color of the left border is black, while the other borders are red.\n This is due to [border-left](#propdef-border-left) setting the width, style, and color.\n Since the color value is not given by the border-left property,\n it will be taken from the [color](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#propdef-color) property.\n The fact that the color property is set after the border-left property\n is not relevant.",

Corner Shaping[](#corner-shaping)\n \nThe [padding edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#padding-edge) (inner border) radius is\n the outer border radius minus the corresponding border thickness.\n In the case where this results in a negative value,\n the inner radius is zero.\n (In such cases the center of the border’s inner curve might not coincide\n with that of its outer curve.)\n Likewise the [content edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#content-edge) radius is\n the padding edge radius minus the corresponding [padding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#padding),\n or if that is negative, zero.\n The border and padding thicknesses in the curved region\n are thus interpolated from the adjoining sides,\n and when two adjoining borders are of different thicknesses\n the corner will show a smooth transition\n between the thicker and thinner borders.\n\n \nAll border styles ([solid](#valdef-line-style-solid), [dotted](#valdef-line-style-dotted), [inset](#valdef-line-style-inset), etc.)\n follow the curve of the border.\n\n \n \n The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it connects\n are of unequal thickness (left)\n and the effect of a rounded corner on borders\n that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right). \n \n \nNote: If the center of a corner’s outer curve\n is past an opposite [padding edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#padding-edge) (in the [border area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#border-area) of a side opposite the corner),\n the inner curve will not be a full quarter ellipse.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n```\np { width: 70px; height: 70px; border: solid 30px;\nborder-color: orange orange silver silver;\nborder-top-right-radius: 100%; }\n\n```\n\n \n \n Where the border-radius curve extends into the opposite sides' borders,\n the arc of the padding edge is less than 90°. \n \n \nThe [margin edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#margin-edge), being outside the [border edge](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#border-edge),\n calculates its radius by adding the corresponding margin thickness\n to each border radius.\n However, in order to create a sharper corner when the border radius is small\n (and thus ensure continuity between round and sharp corners),\n when the [border radius](#border-radii) is less than the margin,\n the margin is multiplied by the proportion 1 + (r-1)3,\n where r is the ratio of the border radius to the margin,\n in calculating the corner radii of the margin box shape.\n\n 4.3. Corner Clipping[](#corner-clipping)\n \nAlthough [border images](#border-image) are not affected by [border-radius](#propdef-border-radius),\n other effects that clip painting or event handling\n to the [border](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#border-edge), [padding](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#padding-edge), or [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-4/#content-edge) edge\n must clip to their respective curves.\n For example,\n backgrounds clip to the curve specified by [background-clip](#propdef-background-clip), [overflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#propdef-overflow) values other than visible to the curved padding edge (when overflow on both axes is not visible), [replaced element](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#replaced-element) content to the curved content edge,\n pointer events to the curved border edge,\n etc.\n\n \nNote: As [border-radius](#propdef-border-radius) reduces the interactive area of an element\n authors should make sure the remaining interactive area conforms\n to recommended minima for the platforms they target;\n in particular, conforming to recommended minimum touch target sizes\n may require larger widths and heights when border-radius is used.\n\n \n [](#example-b5486bac) This example adds appropriate padding,\n so that the contents do not overflow the corners.\n Note that there is no border,\n but the background will still have rounded corners. \n\n```\nDIV {\n background: black;\n color: white;\n border-radius: 1em;\n padding: 1em }\n\n```\n\n \n 4.4. Color and Style Transitions[](#corner-transitions)\n \nColor and style transitions must be contained\n within the segment of the border that intersects\n the smallest rectangle that contains both border radii\n as well as the center of the inner curve\n (which may be a point representing the corner of the padding edge,\n if the border radii are smaller than the [border width](#border-width-dfn)).\n\n \nIf one of these borders is zero-width,\n then the other border takes up the entire transitional area.\n Otherwise,\n the center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders\n is a point along the curve that is a continuous monotonic function\n of the ratio of the border widths.\n However it is not defined what these transitions look like\n or what function maps from this ratio to a point on the curve.\n\n \n \n Given these corner shapes, color and style transitions\n must be contained within the green region.\n In case D the rectangle defined by the border radii\n does not include the center of the inner curve (which is a sharp corner),\n so the transition region is expanded to include that corner.\n Transitions may take up the entire transition region,\n but are not required to:\n For example, a gradient color transition between two solid border styles\n might take up only the region bounded by\n the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii\n (represented in case D by the dark green region). \n \n 4.5. Overlapping Curves[](#corner-overlap)\n \nCorner curves must not overlap:\n When the sum of any two adjacent border radii\n exceeds the size of the border box,\n UAs must proportionally reduce\n the used values of all border radii\n until none of them overlap.\n The algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:\n\n \nLet f = min(Li/Si),\n where i ∈ {top, right, bottom, left}, Si is the sum of the two corresponding radii\n of the corners on side i,\n and Ltop = Lbottom = the width of the box,\n and Lleft = Lright = the height of the box.\n If f < 1, then all corner radii are reduced\n by multiplying them by f.\n\n \nNote: This formula ensures that quarter circles remain quarter circles\n and large radii remain larger than smaller ones,\n but it may reduce corners that were already small enough,\n which may make borders of nearby elements that should look the same\n look different.\n\n \nIf the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars,\n the UA may further reduce the used value of the affected border radii\n (and only the affected border radii)\n as much as necessary, but no more.\n\n \n [](#example-830e0800) For example, the borders A of the [figure below](#reduced-radius) might be the result of \n\n```\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n\n```\n\n \nThe height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus 2.0em).\n However, if the height is only 2em,\n\n```\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n\n```\n\n \nall corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit.\n The used border radii thus are\n 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of 2em).\n See borders B in the figure.\n\n \n \n These rounded corner might be the result of\n 'width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em''\n for A; and ditto but with [height: 2em](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#propdef-height) for B. \n \n \n 4.6. Effect on Tables[](#border-radius-tables)\n \nThe [border-radius](#propdef-border-radius) properties do apply to table, [inline-table](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#value-def-inline-table), and [table-cell](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#value-def-table-cell) boxes\n in separated borders mode ([border-collapse: separate](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#propdef-border-collapse)).\n When border-collapse is [collapse](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#valdef-border-collapse-collapse), they have no effect.",

Shadow Shape, Spread, and Knockout[](#shadow-shape)\n \nAn [outer box-shadow](#box-shadow-outer-box-shadow) casts a shadow\n as if the border-box of the element were opaque.\n Assuming a spread distance of zero, its perimeter has\n the exact same size and shape as the border box.\n The shadow is drawn outside the border edge only:\n it is clipped inside the border-box of the element.\n\n \nAn [inner box-shadow](#box-shadow-inner-box-shadow) casts a shadow\n as if everything outside the padding edge were opaque.\n Assuming a spread distance of zero, its perimeter has\n the exact same size and shape as the padding box.\n The shadow is drawn inside the padding edge only:\n it is clipped outside the padding box of the element.\n\n \nIf a [spread distance](#box-shadow-spread-distance) is defined,\n the shadow perimeter defined above\n is expanded outward (for [outer box-shadows](#box-shadow-outer-box-shadow))\n or contracted inward (for [inner box-shadows](#box-shadow-inner-box-shadow))\n by outsetting (insetting, for inner shadows)\n the shadow’s straight edges by the spread distance (and flooring the resulting width/height at zero).\n\n \n [](#example-96985467) Below are some examples of an orange box with a blue border\n being given a drop shadow. \n \n \n \n \n\n```\n`border:5px solid blue;\nbackground-color:orange;\nwidth: 144px;\nheight: 144px;\n`\n```\n\n \n\n```\n`border-radius: 20px;`\n```\n\n \n\n```\n`border-radius: 0;`\n```\n\n \n \n\n```\n`box-shadow:\n rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n 10px 10px;\n`\n```\n\n \n \n \n \n\n```\n`box-shadow:\n rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n 10px 10px\n inset\n`\n```\n\n \n \n \n \n\n```\n`box-shadow:\n rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n 10px 10px 0\n 10px /* spread */\n`\n```\n\n \n \n \n \n\n```\n`box-shadow:\n rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n 10px 10px 0\n 10px /* spread */\n inset\n`\n```\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTo preserve the box’s shape when spread is applied,\n the corner radii of the shadow are also increased (decreased, for inner shadows)\n from the border-box (padding-box) radii by adding (subtracting)\n the [spread distance](#box-shadow-spread-distance) (and flooring at zero).\n However, in order to create a sharper corner when the border radius is small\n (and thus ensure continuity between round and sharp corners),\n when the [border radius](#border-radii) is less than the spread distance (or in the case of an inner shadow,\n less than the absolute value of a negative spread distance),\n the spread distance is first multiplied by the proportion 1 + (r-1)3,\n where r is the ratio of the border radius to the spread distance,\n in calculating the corner radii of the spread shadow shape.\n For example, if the border radius is 10px and the spread distance is 20px (r = .5),\n the corner radius of the shadow shape will be 10px + 20px × (1 + (.5 - 1)3) = 27.5px\n rather than 30px.\n This adjustment is applied independently to the radii in each dimension.\n\n \nThe [border-image](#propdef-border-image) does not affect the shape of the box-shadow.\n\n 6.1.2. Blurring Shadow Edges[](#shadow-blur)\n \nA non-zero [blur radius](#box-shadow-blur-radius) indicates\n that the resulting shadow should be blurred,\n such as by a Gaussian filter.\n The exact algorithm is not defined;\n however the resulting shadow must approximate\n (with each pixel being within 5% of its expected value)\n the image that would be generated by applying to the shadow\n a Gaussian blur with a standard deviation equal to half the blur radius.\n\n \nNote: This means for a long, straight shadow edge,\n the blur radius will create a visibly apparent color transition\n approximately the twice length of the blur radius\n that is perpendicular to and centered on the shadow’s edge,\n and that ranges\n from almost the full shadow color at the endpoint inside the shadow\n to almost fully transparent at the endpoint outside it.\n\n 6.1.3. Layering, Layout, and Other Details[](#shadow-layers)\n \nThe shadow effects are applied front-to-back:\n the first shadow is on top and the others are layered behind.\n Shadows do not influence layout and may overlap (or be overlapped by)\n other boxes and text or their shadows.\n In terms of stacking contexts and the painting order,\n the [outer box-shadows](#box-shadow-outer-box-shadow) of an element are drawn immediately below the background of that element,\n and the [inner shadows](#box-shadow-inner-box-shadow) of an element are drawn immediately above the background of that element\n (below the borders and border image, if any).\n\n \nUnless otherwise specified, drop shadows are only applied to the [principal box](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#principal-box).\n If the affected box has multiple fragments,\n the shadows are applied as specified in [box-decoration-break](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-4/#propdef-box-decoration-break).\n\n \nShadows do not trigger scrolling or increase the size of the [scrollable overflow area](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#scrollable-overflow-region).\n\n \nOuter shadows have no effect on internal table elements in the collapsing border model.\n If a shadow is defined for single border edge in the collapsing border model\n that has multiple border thicknesses\n (e.g. an outer shadow on a table where one row has thicker borders than the others,\n or an inner shadow on a rowspanning table cell that adjoins cells with different border thicknesses),\n the exact position and rendering of its shadows are undefined",
