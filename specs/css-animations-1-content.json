      "content": "This section is not normative\n\n \nCSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]](#biblio-css3-transitions) provide a way to interpolate\n CSS property values when they change as a result of underlying\n property changes. This provides an easy way to do simple animation,\n but the start and end states of the animation are controlled by the\n existing property values, and transitions provide little control to\n the author on how the animation progresses.\n\n \nThis proposal introduces defined animations, in which the author can\n specify the changes in CSS properties over time as a set of keyframes.\n Animations are similar to transitions in that they change the\n presentational value of CSS properties over time. The principal difference\n is that while transitions trigger implicitly when property values change,\n animations are explicitly executed when the animation properties are applied.\n Because of this, animations require explicit values for the properties\n being animated. These values are specified using animation keyframes,\n described below.\n\n \nMany aspects of the animation can be controlled, including how many times\n the animation iterates, whether or not it alternates between the begin and\n end values, and whether or not the animation should be running or paused.\n An animation can also delay its start time.\n\n 1.1. Value Definitions[](#values)\n \nThis specification follows the [CSS property definition conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs) from [[CSS2]](#biblio-css2) using the [value definition syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs) from [[CSS-VALUES-3]](#biblio-css-values-3).\n Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [CSS-VALUES-3].\n Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.\n\n \nIn addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,\n all properties defined in this specification\n also accept the [CSS-wide keywords](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-wide-keywords) as their property value.\n For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.",

      "content": "CSS Animations affect computed property values. This effect happens by\n adding a specified value to the CSS cascade ([[CSS3CASCADE]](#biblio-css3cascade)) (at the\n level for CSS Animations) that will produce the correct computed value\n for the current state of the animation. As defined in [CSS3CASCADE],\n animations override all normal rules, but are overridden by !important\n rules.\n\n \nIf at some point in time there are multiple animations specifying behavior\n for the same property, the animation which occurs last in the value\n of [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) will override the other animations at that point.\n\n \nAn animation does not affect the computed value before the application of the\n animation (that is, when the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property is set on an element)\n or after it is removed. Furthermore, typically an animation does not affect\n the computed value before the animation delay has expired or after the end of\n the animation, but may do so depending on the [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) property.\n\n \nWhile running, the animation computes the value of those properties\n it animates. Other values may take precedence over the animated value\n according to the CSS cascade ([[CSS3CASCADE]](#biblio-css3cascade)).\n\n \nWhile an animation is applied but has not finished, or has finished but has\n an [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) of [forwards](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-forwards) or [both](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-both), the user agent must act\n as if the [will-change](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-will-change-1/#propdef-will-change) property ([[css-will-change-1]](#biblio-css-will-change-1)) on the element\n additionally includes all the properties animated by the animation.\n\n \nThe start time of an animation is the time at which the style applying\n the animation and the corresponding @keyframes rule are both resolved.\n If an animation is specified for an element but the corresponding\n @keyframes rule does not yet exist, the animation cannot start; the\n animation will start from the beginning as soon as a matching @keyframes\n rule can be resolved. An animation specified by dynamically modifying the\n element’s style will start when this style is resolved; that may be\n immediately in the case of a pseudo style rule such as hover, or may be\n when the scripting engine returns control to the browser (in the case of\n style applied by script). Note that dynamically updating keyframe style\n rules does not start or re-start an animation.\n\n \nAn animation applies to an element if its name appears as one of the\n identifiers in the computed value of the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property and the\n animation uses a valid @keyframes rule. Once an\n animation has started it continues until it ends or the animation-name is\n removed. Changes to the values of animation properties while the animation\n is running apply as if the animation had those values from when it\n began. For example, shortening the [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay) may cause the animation\n to jump forwards or even finish immediately and dispatch an [animationend](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationend) event.\n Conversely, extending the animation-delay may cause an animation to\n re-start and dispatch an [animationstart](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationstart) event.\n\n \nThe same @keyframes rule name may be repeated within an [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name).\n Changes to the animation-name update existing animations by iterating over\n the new list of animations from last to first, and, for each animation,\n finding the last matching animation in the list of existing\n animations.\n If a match is found, the existing animation is updated using the animation\n properties corresponding to its position in the new list of animations,\n whilst maintaining its current playback time as described above.\n The matching animation is removed from the existing list of animations such\n that it will not match twice.\n If a match is not found, a new animation is created.\n As a result, updating animation-name from ‘a’ to\n ‘a, a’ will cause the existing animation for ‘a’ to\n become the second animation in the list and a new animation will be\n created for the first item in the list.\n\n \n [](#example-4e34d7ba) \n\n```\ndiv {\n animation-name: diagonal-slide;\n animation-duration: 5s;\n animation-iteration-count: 10;\n}\n\n@keyframes diagonal-slide {\n\n from {\n left: 0;\n top: 0;\n }\n\n to {\n left: 100px;\n top: 100px;\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThis will produce an animation that moves an element from (0, 0) to\n (100px, 100px) over five seconds and repeats itself nine times\n (for a total of ten iterations).\n\n \n \nSetting the [display](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#propdef-display) property to [none](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#valdef-display-none) will terminate any running animation applied\n to the element and its descendants. If an element has a display of none, updating display to a value other than none will start all animations applied to the element\n by the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property, as well as all animations applied to descendants\n with display other than none.\n\n \nWhile authors can use animations to create dynamically changing content, dynamically\n changing content can lead to seizures in some users. For information on how to avoid\n content that can lead to seizures, see Guideline 2.3: Seizures: Do not design content\n in a way that is known to cause seizures ([[WCAG20]](#biblio-wcag20)).\n\n \nImplementations may ignore animations when the rendering medium is not interactive e.g. when printed.\n A future version of this specification may define how to render animations for these media.",

      "content": "Keyframes are used to specify the values for the animating properties at various points\n during the animation. The keyframes specify the behavior of one cycle of the animation;\n the animation may iterate zero or more times.\n\n \nKeyframes are specified using the **@keyframes** at-rule,\n defined as follows:\n\n```\n@keyframes = @keyframes [<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name) { [<rule-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-rule-list) }\n\n**<keyframes-name>** = [<custom-ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#identifier-value) | [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value)\n\n**<keyframe-block>** = [<keyframe-selector>](#typedef-keyframe-selector)# { [<declaration-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-declaration-list) }\n\n**<keyframe-selector>** = from | to | [<percentage [0,100]>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#percentage-value)\n\n```\n\n \nThe [<rule-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-rule-list) inside of [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) can only contain [<keyframe-block>](#typedef-keyframe-block) rules.\n\n \nThe [<declaration-list>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#typedef-declaration-list) inside of [<keyframe-block>](#typedef-keyframe-block) accepts any CSS property\n except those defined in this specification,\n but does accept the [animation-timing-function](#propdef-animation-timing-function) property\n and interprets it specially.\n None of the properties interact with the cascade\n (so using !important on them is invalid and will cause the property to be ignored).\n\n \nA [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) block has a name given by the [<custom-ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#identifier-value) or [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value) in its prelude.\n The two syntaxes are equivalent in functionality;\n the name is the value of the ident or string.\n As normal for <custom-ident>s and <string>s,\n the names are fully case-sensitive;\n two names are equal only if they are codepoint-by-codepoint equal.\n The <custom-ident> additionally excludes the [none](#valdef-animation-name-none) keyword.\n\n \n [](#example-d0936079) For example, the following two [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rules have the same name,\n so the first will be ignored: \n\n```\n@keyframes foo { /* ... */ }\n@keyframes \"foo\" { /* ... */ }\n\n```\n\n \nOn the other hand,\n the following [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rule’s name is different from the previous two rules:\n\n```\n@keyframes FOO { /* ... */ }\n\n```\n\n \nThe following [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rules are invalid\n because they use disallowed [<custom-ident>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#identifier-value) values:\n\n```\n@keyframes initial { /* ... */ }\n@keyframes None { /* ... */ }\n\n```\n\n \nHowever, those names can be specified with a [<string>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#string-value),\n so the following are both valid:\n\n```\n@keyframes \"initial\" { /* ... */ }\n@keyframes \"None\" { /* ... */ }\n\n```\n\n \n \nThe [<keyframe-selector>](#typedef-keyframe-selector) for a [<keyframe-block>](#typedef-keyframe-block) consists of a comma-separated list of percentage values or the keywords from or [to](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes-2/#valdef-shape-to). The selector is used to specify the percentage along the duration of the animation that the keyframe represents. The keyframe itself is specified by the block of property values declared on the selector. The keyword from is equivalent to the value 0%. The keyword to is equivalent to the value 100%.\n Values less than 0% or higher than 100% are invalid\n and cause their <keyframe-block> to be ignored.\n\n \nNote that the percentage unit specifier must be used on percentage values. Therefore, 0 is an invalid keyframe selector.\n\n \nIf a 0% or from keyframe is not specified, then the user agent constructs a 0% keyframe\n using the computed values of the properties being animated. If a 100% or [to](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes-2/#valdef-shape-to) keyframe is not\n specified, then the user agent constructs a 100% keyframe using the computed values of the\n properties being animated.\n\n \nThe [<keyframe-block>](#typedef-keyframe-block) contains properties and values. The properties\n defined by this specification are ignored in these rules, with the exception of [animation-timing-function](#propdef-animation-timing-function), the behavior of which is described below. In addition, properties qualified with !important are invalid and ignored.\n\n \nIf multiple [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rules are defined with the same name,\n the last one in document order wins,\n and all preceding ones are ignored.\n\n \n [](#example-b784185b) \n\n```\ndiv {\n animation-name: slide-right;\n animation-duration: 2s;\n}\n\n@keyframes slide-right {\n\n from {\n margin-left: 0px;\n }\n\n 50% {\n margin-left: 110px;\n opacity: 1;\n }\n\n 50% {\n opacity: 0.9;\n }\n\n to {\n margin-left: 200px;\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n \nThe two 50% rules from above can also be combined into an equivalent single rule\nas illustrated below:\n\n```\n@keyframes slide-right {\n\n from {\n margin-left: 0px;\n }\n\n 50% {\n margin-left: 110px;\n opacity: 0.9;\n }\n\n to {\n margin-left: 200px;\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n \n \nTo determine the set of keyframes, all of the values in the selectors are sorted in increasing order\n by time. The rules within the [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rule then cascade; the properties of a keyframe may thus derive\n from more than one @keyframes rule with the same selector value.\n\n \nIf a property is not specified for a keyframe, or is specified but invalid, the animation of that\n property proceeds as if that keyframe did not exist. Conceptually, it is as if a set of keyframes is\n constructed for each property that is present in any of the keyframes, and an animation is run\n independently for each property.\n\n \n [](#example-10d90bd9) \n\n```\n@keyframes wobble {\n 0% {\n left: 100px;\n }\n\n 40% {\n left: 150px;\n }\n\n 60% {\n left: 75px;\n }\n\n 100% {\n left: 100px;\n }\n}\n\n```\n\n \nFour keyframes are specified for the animation named \"wobble\". In the first keyframe,\n shown at the beginning of the animation cycle, the value of the [left](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-position-3/#propdef-left) property being\n animated is 100px. By 40% of the animation duration, left has animated to 150px.\n At 60% of the animation duration, left has animated back to 75px. At the end of the\n animation cycle, the value of left has returned to 100px. The diagram below shows\n the state of the animation if it were given a duration of 10s.\n\n \n \n Animation states specified by keyframes\n \n \n \n[](#issue-73aacf21) This specification needs to define\n how the value is determined from the keyframes,\n like the section on [Application of transitions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions/#application) does for CSS Transitions. \n\n 3.1. Timing functions for keyframes[](#timing-functions)\n \nA keyframe style rule may also declare the timing function that is to be used as the animation\n moves to the next keyframe.\n\n \n [](#example-a9d2ebec) \n\n```\n@keyframes bounce {\n\n from {\n top: 100px;\n animation-timing-function: ease-out;\n }\n\n 25% {\n top: 50px;\n animation-timing-function: ease-in;\n }\n\n 50% {\n top: 100px;\n animation-timing-function: ease-out;\n }\n\n 75% {\n top: 75px;\n animation-timing-function: ease-in;\n }\n\n to {\n top: 100px;\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n \nFive keyframes are specified for the animation named \"bounce\". Between the first and second\n keyframe (i.e., between 0% and 25%) an ease-out timing function is used. Between the second\n and third keyframe (i.e., between 25% and 50%) an ease-in timing function is used. And so on.\n The effect will appear as an element that moves up the page 50px, slowing down as it reaches\n its highest point then speeding up as it falls back to 100px. The second half of the animation\n behaves in a similar manner, but only moves the element 25px up the page.\n\n \n \nA timing function specified on the [to](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes-2/#valdef-shape-to) or 100% keyframe is ignored.\n\n \nSee the [animation-timing-function](#propdef-animation-timing-function) property for more information.\n\n 3.2. The [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property[](#animation-name)\n \nThe [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property defines a list of animations that apply. Each name is used to select\n the keyframe at-rule that provides the property values for the animation. If the name does not match\n any keyframe at-rule, there are no properties to be animated and the animation will not execute.\n Furthermore, if the animation name is `none` then there will be no animation. This can be\n used to override any animations coming from the cascade. If multiple animations are attempting to\n modify the same property, then the animation closest to the end of the list of names wins.\n\n \nEach animation listed by name should have a corresponding value for the other animation properties\n listed below. If the lists of values for the other animation properties do not have the same length,\n the length of the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) list determines the number of items in each list examined when\n starting animations. The lists are matched up from the first value: excess values at the end are not\n used. If one of the other properties doesn’t have enough comma-separated values to match the number of\n values of animation-name, the UA must calculate its used value by repeating the list of values until\n there are enough. This truncation or repetition does not affect the computed value.\n\n \nNote: This is analogous to the behavior of the background-* properties, with [background-image](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#propdef-background-image) analogous to [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name).\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-name**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [ none [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) [<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name) ][#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n none \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item either a case-sensitive [css identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#css-css-identifier) or the keyword [none](#valdef-animation-name-none) \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \nThe values of [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) have the following meanings:\n\n \n **none** \n No keyframes are specified at all, so there will be no animation.\n Any other animations properties specified for this animation have no effect. \n **[<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name)[](#valdef-animation-name-keyframes-name)** \n The animation will use the keyframes with the name specified by the [<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name),\n if they exist.\n If no [@keyframes](#at-ruledef-keyframes) rule with that name exists, there is no animation. \n \n 3.3.

The [animation-iteration-count](#propdef-animation-iteration-count) property[](#animation-iteration-count)\n \nThe [animation-iteration-count](#propdef-animation-iteration-count) property specifies the number of times an animation cycle\n is played. The initial value is 1, meaning the animation will play from beginning to end\n once. This property is often used in conjunction with an [animation-direction](#propdef-animation-direction) value of [alternate](#valdef-animation-direction-alternate), which will cause the animation to play in\n reverse on alternate cycles.\n\n \nThe time window during which the animation is active\n (`duration` x `iteration-count`)\n is known as the **active duration**.\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-iteration-count**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<single-animation-iteration-count>](#typedef-single-animation-iteration-count)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n 1 \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item either a number or the keyword [infinite](#valdef-animation-iteration-count-infinite) \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n**<single-animation-iteration-count>** = infinite [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) [<number [0,∞]>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#number-value)\n\n \n **infinite** \n The animation will repeat forever. \n **[<number [0,∞]>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#number-value)[](#valdef-animation-iteration-count-number-0)** \n \n \nThe animation will repeat the specified number of times.\n If the number is not an integer,\n the animation will end partway through its last cycle.\n Negative numbers are invalid. \n\n \nA value of 0 is valid and, similar to an [animation-duration](#propdef-animation-duration) of 0s, causes the animation to occur instantaneously. \n\n \n \nIf the animation has a duration of 0s, it will occur instantaneously for any\n valid value of [animation-iteration-count](#propdef-animation-iteration-count), including [infinite](#valdef-animation-iteration-count-infinite).\n\n 3.6. The [animation-direction](#propdef-animation-direction) property[](#animation-direction)\n \nThe [animation-direction](#propdef-animation-direction) property defines whether or not the animation should play in reverse\n on some or all cycles. When an animation is played in reverse the timing functions are also\n reversed. For example, when played in reverse an [ease-in](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-in) animation would appear to be an [ease-out](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#valdef-cubic-bezier-easing-function-ease-out) animation.\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-direction**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<single-animation-direction>](#typedef-single-animation-direction)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n normal \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item a keyword as specified \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n**<single-animation-direction>** = normal [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) reverse | alternate | alternate-reverse\n\n \n **normal** \n All iterations of the animation are played as specified. \n **reverse** \n All iterations of the animation are played in the reverse direction\n from the way they were specified. \n **alternate** \n The animation cycle iterations that are odd counts are played in the\n normal direction, and the animation cycle iterations that are even\n counts are played in a reverse direction. \n **alternate-reverse** \n The animation cycle iterations that are odd counts are played in the\n reverse direction, and the animation cycle iterations that are even\n counts are played in a normal direction. \n \n \nNote: For the purpose of determining whether an iteration is even or odd,\n iterations start counting from 1.\n\n 3.7. The [animation-play-state](#propdef-animation-play-state) property[](#animation-play-state)\n \nThe [animation-play-state](#propdef-animation-play-state) property defines whether the animation is running or paused.\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-play-state**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<single-animation-play-state>](#typedef-single-animation-play-state)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n running \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item a keyword as specified \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n**<single-animation-play-state>** = running [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) paused\n\n \n **running** \n While this property is set to [running](#valdef-animation-play-state-running),\n the animation proceeds as normal. \n **paused** \n \n While this property is set to [paused](#valdef-animation-play-state-paused),\n the animation is paused.\n The animation continues to apply to the element with the progress it had made before being paused.\n When unpaused (set back to [running](#valdef-animation-play-state-running)), it restarts from where it left off,\n as if the \"clock\" that controls the animation had stopped and started again. \n \nIf the property is set to [paused](#valdef-animation-play-state-paused) during the delay phase of the animation,\n the delay clock is also paused and resumes as soon as [animation-play-state](#propdef-animation-play-state) is set back to [running](#valdef-animation-play-state-running).\n\n \n 3.8. The [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay) property[](#animation-delay)\n \nThe [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay) property defines when the animation will start. It allows an animation\n to begin execution some time after it is applied,\n or to appear to have begun execution some time before it is applied.\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-delay**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<time>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#time-value)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n 0s \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item a duration \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n **[<time>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#time-value)[](#valdef-animation-delay-time)** \n \n The [<time>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#time-value) defines how long of a delay there is between the start of the animation\n (when the animation is applied to the element via these properties)\n and when it begins executing.\n A delay of 0s (the initial value) means that the animation will execute as soon as it is applied. \n \nA negative delay is valid.\n Similar to a delay of 0s, it means that the animation executes immediately,\n but is automatically progressed by the absolute value of the delay,\n as if the animation had started the specified time in the past,\n and so it appears to start partway through its [active duration](#animation-iteration-count).\n If an animation’s keyframes have an implied starting value,\n the values are taken from the time the animation starts,\n not some time in the past.\n\n \n 3.9. The [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) property[](#animation-fill-mode)\n \nThe [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) property defines what values are applied by the animation\n outside the time it is executing. By default, an animation will not affect property\n values between the time it is applied (the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) property is set on an\n element) and the time it begins execution (which is determined by the [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay) property). Also, by default an animation does not affect property values after the\n animation ends (determined by the [animation-duration](#propdef-animation-duration) and [animation-iteration-count](#propdef-animation-iteration-count) properties).\n The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior. Dynamic updates to the property will\n be reflected by property values as needed, whether during the animation delay or after the animation ends.\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation-fill-mode**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<single-animation-fill-mode>](#typedef-single-animation-fill-mode)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n none \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n list, each item a keyword as specified \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n**<single-animation-fill-mode>** = none [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) forwards | backwards | both\n\n \n **none** \n The animation has no effect when it is applied but not executing. \n **forwards** \n After the animation ends (as determined by its [animation-iteration-count](#propdef-animation-iteration-count)), the animation\n will apply the property values for the time the animation ended. When animation-iteration-count is an integer greater than zero, the values applied will be those for the end of the last\n completed iteration of the animation (rather than the values for the start of the iteration\n that would be next). When animation-iteration-count is zero, the values applied will be\n those that would start the first iteration (just as when [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) is [backwards](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-backwards)). \n **backwards** \n During the period defined by [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay), the animation will apply the property values\n defined in the keyframe that will start the first iteration of the animation.\n These are either the values of the from keyframe (when [animation-direction](#propdef-animation-direction) is [normal](#valdef-animation-direction-normal) or [alternate](#valdef-animation-direction-alternate)) or those of the [to](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes-2/#valdef-shape-to) keyframe (when animation-direction is [reverse](#valdef-animation-direction-reverse) or [alternate-reverse](#valdef-animation-direction-alternate-reverse)). \n **both** \n The effects of both [forwards](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-forwards) and [backwards](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-backwards) fill apply. \n \n 3.10. The [animation](#propdef-animation) shorthand property[](#animation)\n \nThe [animation](#propdef-animation) shorthand property is a comma-separated list of animation definitions. Each item in\n the list gives one item of the value for all of the subproperties of the shorthand, which are known\n as the animation properties. (See the definition of [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) for what happens when these\n properties have lists of different lengths, a problem that cannot occur when they are defined using\n only the animation shorthand.)\n\n \n \n \n Name:\n **animation**\n \n [Value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#value-defs)\n [<single-animation>](#typedef-single-animation)[#](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#mult-comma) \n \n [Initial:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#initial-values)\n see individual properties \n \n [Applies to:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#applies-to)\n [all elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo/#generated-content) \n \n [Inherited:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#inherited-property)\n no \n \n [Percentages:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#percentages)\n N/A \n \n [Computed value:](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/#computed)\n see individual properties \n \n [Canonical order:](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#serializing-css-values)\n per grammar \n \n [Animation type:](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/#animation-type)\n not animatable \n \n \n**<single-animation>** = [<time>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#time-value) [||](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-any) [<easing-function>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#typedef-easing-function) || <time> || [<single-animation-iteration-count>](#typedef-single-animation-iteration-count) || [<single-animation-direction>](#typedef-single-animation-direction) || [<single-animation-fill-mode>](#typedef-single-animation-fill-mode) || [<single-animation-play-state>](#typedef-single-animation-play-state) || [ none [|](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#comb-one) [<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name) ]\n\n \nNote that order is important within each animation definition: the first value in each [<single-animation>](#typedef-single-animation) that can be parsed as a [<time>](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#time-value) is assigned to the [animation-duration](#propdef-animation-duration),\n and the second value in each <single-animation> that can be parsed as a <time> is assigned to [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay).\n\n \nNote that order is also important within each animation definition for distinguishing [<keyframes-name>](#typedef-keyframes-name) values from other keywords. When parsing, keywords that are valid for\n properties other than [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) whose values were not found earlier in the shorthand\n must be accepted for those properties rather than for animation-name. Furthermore, when serializing, default values of other properties must be\n output in at least the cases necessary to distinguish an animation-name that could\n be a value of another property, and may be output in additional cases.\n\n [](#example-f4782312) For example, a value parsed from [animation: 3s none backwards](#propdef-animation) (where [animation-fill-mode](#propdef-animation-fill-mode) is [none](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-none) and [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) is backwards)\n must not be serialized as animation: 3s backwards (where animation-fill-mode is [backwards](#valdef-animation-fill-mode-backwards) and animation-name is [none](#valdef-animation-name-none)).",

The start and\n end of an animation, and the end of each iteration of an animation, all generate DOM events.\n An element can have multiple properties being animated simultaneously.

For the purposes of events, each animation-name specifies\n a single animation. Therefore an event will be generated for each animation-name value and\n not necessarily for each property being animated.\n\n \nAny animation for which a valid keyframe rule is defined will run\n and generate events; this includes animations with empty keyframe rules.\n\n \nThe time the animation has been running is sent with each event generated.

Types of `AnimationEvent`[](#event-animationevent)\n \nThe different types of animation events that can occur are:\n\n \n **`animationstart`** \n \n The [animationstart](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationstart) event occurs at the start of the animation.\n If there is an [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay) then this event will fire once the delay\n period has expired. \n \n A negative delay will cause the event to fire with\n an [elapsedTime](#dom-animationevent-elapsedtime) equal to the absolute value of the delay\n capped to the [active duration](#active-duration) of the animation, that is, `min(max(-[animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay), 0), [active duration](#active-duration))`; in\n this case the event will fire whether [animation-play-state](#propdef-animation-play-state) is set to [running](#valdef-animation-play-state-running) or [paused](#valdef-animation-play-state-paused). \n\n \n\n Bubbles: Yes\n Cancelable: No\n Context Info: animationName, elapsedTime, pseudoElement\n \n\n **`animationend`** \n \n The [animationend](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationend) event occurs when the animation finishes.\n In this case the value of the [elapsedTime](#dom-animationevent-elapsedtime) member of\n the event is equal to the [active duration](#active-duration). \n \n\n Bubbles: Yes\n Cancelable: No\n Context Info: animationName, elapsedTime, pseudoElement\n \n\n **`animationiteration`** \n \n The [animationiteration](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationiteration) event occurs at the end of each iteration of an\n animation, except when an animationend event would fire at the same time.\n This means that this event does not occur for animations with an iteration\n count of one or less. \n \nThe [elapsedTime](#dom-animationevent-elapsedtime) member in this case is equal to the\n product of the current iteration and [animation-duration](#propdef-animation-duration) where\n the current iteration is the zero-based index of the new\n iteration. For example, assuming no negative [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay), after one\n iteration completes the current iteration would be one.\n\n \n\n Bubbles: Yes\n Cancelable: No\n Context Info: animationName, elapsedTime, pseudoElement\n \n\n **`animationcancel`** \n \n The [animationcancel](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationcancel) event occurs when the animation stops\n running in a way that does not fire an [animationend](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationend) event, such\n as a change in the [animation-name](#propdef-animation-name) that removes the animation, or the\n animating element or one of its ancestors becoming display:none. \n \nThe [elapsedTime](#dom-animationevent-elapsedtime) member for this event indicates\n the number of seconds that had elapsed since the beginning of the\n animation at the moment when the animation was canceled.\n This excludes any time where the animation was paused. If the animation\n had a negative [animation-delay](#propdef-animation-delay), the beginning of the animation is the\n moment equal to the absolute value of animation-delay seconds prior to when the animation was actually triggered.\n Alternatively, if the animation had a positive animation-delay and the\n event is fired before the animation’s delay has expired, the [elapsedTime](#dom-animationevent-elapsedtime) will be zero.\n\n \n\n Bubbles: Yes\n Cancelable: No\n Context Info: animationName, elapsedTime, pseudoElement\n \n\n \n 4.3. Event\nhandlers on elements, `Document` objects, and `Window` objects[](#event-handlers-on-elements-document-objects-and-window-objects)\n \nThe following are the [event handlers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handlers) (and their corresponding [event\nhandler event types](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type)) that must be supported by all [HTML elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#html-elements), as\nboth [event handler content attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handler-content-attributes) and [event handler IDL\nattributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handler-idl-attributes); and that must be supported by all [Document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document) and [Window](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#window) objects, as event handler IDL attributes:\n\n \n \n \n [Event handler](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handlers)\n [Event handler event type](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type)\n \n **`onanimationstart`[](#dom-document-onanimationstart)**\n [animationstart](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationstart)\n \n **`onanimationiteration`[](#dom-document-onanimationiteration)**\n [animationiteration](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationiteration)\n \n **`onanimationend`[](#dom-document-onanimationend)**\n [animationend](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationend)\n \n **`onanimationcancel`[](#dom-document-onanimationcancel)**\n [animationcancel](#eventdef-globaleventhandlers-animationcancel)",

They take their starting values below 50% timing function progress, and end values above\n \n Dynamic changes to animation properties/keyframes. Tab to propose resolution. ([Bug 14713](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14713)) \n \n Negative animation-delay values apply against the active duration of the animation i.e. (animation-duration*animation-iteration-count). The delay can thus swallow iterations for which no iteration event will be fired. The start/end events are still fired. Even when delay == (-1*active_duration) \n \n Fire animation start/end events when animation-duration is zero, with 0 elapsedTime \n \n If animation-iteration-count is infinite and duration is 0, treat the iteration-count as if it was finite and run a 0s second (option A in [Brian’s mail](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Sep/0056.html)) \n \n If an animation with a negative animation delay is initially paused, the start event still fires \n \n\n \n 2012-10-29 minutes \n \n\n \n Change the animation properties to be dynamically changeable \n \n @keyframes can be dynamically changed \n \n When you encounter duplicate animations names, last one wins.\n \n Make *animations* transition *all* properties. Unless otherwise specified, discrete properties take their starting values below 50% timing function progress, and end values above 50% timing function progress.\n \n\n \n 2012-12-12 minutes and intermediate comments \n and 2012-12-19 minutes\n \n\n \n Animations only run if they contain at least one valid keyframe rule ([Bug](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15251)) \n \n When an element changes from display:none to display: non-none, animations start immediately ([Bug](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14785))\n \n An initially-paused animation is still started (fires start events etc.) ([Bug](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14774)) \n \n Animations can be paused during their delay phase, which freezes the remaining delay to be applied after it unpauses ([Bug](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14774))\n \n animation-play-state has the same list behavior as the other animation properties, matching the length of animation-name ([Bug](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14786))\n \n\n \n 2013-02-20 minutes \n \n\n \n Øyvind’s clarification accepted\n \n keyframe rules cascade\n \n mark pseudoElement at-risk\n \n\n \n 2013-05-30 minutes \n \n\n \n expectations on animations in non-interactive media\n \n\n \n 2014-01-27 minutes \n \n\n \n remove text about waiting for document load",
