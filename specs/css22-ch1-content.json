      "content": "The CSS community has gained significant experience with the CSS2\nspecification since it became a recommendation in 1998. Errors in the\nCSS2 specification have subsequently been corrected in the first\nrevised edition [[CSS21]](refs.html#ref-CSS21) in 2011, but new errata were necessary.\n\nWhile many of the issues will be addressed by the upcoming CSS3\nspecifications, the current state of affairs hinders the\nimplementation and interoperability of CSS2. The CSS 2.2 specification\nattempts to address this situation by:\n\nMaintaining compatibility with those portions of CSS2 that are\nwidely accepted and implemented.\n \nIncorporating all published CSS2 errata.\n\nWhere implementations overwhelmingly differ from the CSS2\nspecification, modifying the specification to be in accordance with\ngenerally accepted practice.\n\nRemoving CSS2 features which, by virtue of not having been\nimplemented, have been rejected by the CSS community. CSS 2.2 aims to\nreflect what CSS features are reasonably widely implemented for HTML\nand XML languages in general (rather than only for a\nparticular XML language, or only for HTML).\n\nRemoving CSS2 features that will be obsoleted by CSS3, thus\nencouraging adoption of the proposed CSS3 features in their place.\n\nAdding a (very) small number of new\nproperty values, when implementation experience has shown that\nthey are needed for implementing CSS2.\n\nThus, while it is not the case that a CSS2 style sheet is\nnecessarily forwards-compatible with CSS 2.2, it is the case that a\nstyle sheet restricting itself to CSS 2.2 features is more likely to\nfind a compliant user agent today and to preserve forwards\ncompatibility in the future. While breaking forward compatibility is\nnot desirable, we believe the advantages to the revisions in CSS 2.2\nare worthwhile.\n\nCSS 2.2 is derived from and is intended to replace\nCSS 2.1 and CSS2. Some parts of CSS2 are unchanged in\nCSS 2.2, some parts have been\naltered, and some parts removed. The removed portions may be used in a\nfuture CSS3 specification. Future specs should refer to CSS 2.2\n(unless they need features from CSS2 which have been dropped in\nCSS 2.2, and then they should only reference CSS2 for those\nfeatures, or preferably reference such feature(s) in the respective\nCSS3 Module that includes those feature(s)).",

      "content": "This section is non-normative.\n\nThis specification has been written with two types of readers in\nmind: CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will\nprovide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,\nattractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to\nCSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all\nthey need to build [conforming user\nagents](conform.html#conformance).\n\nThe specification begins with a general presentation of CSS and\nbecomes more and more technical and specific towards the end. For\nquick access to information, a general table of contents,\nspecific tables of contents at the beginning of each section,\nand an index provide easy navigation, in both the electronic\nand printed versions.\n\nThe specification has been written with two modes of presentation\nin mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will\nno doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,\nlinks will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page\nnumbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a\ndiscrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative\nversion of the document.",

      "heading": "1.4.2 CSS property definitions",
      "content": "Each CSS property definition begins with a summary of key\ninformation that resembles the following:\n\n \n \n Name:\n **property-name**Value:legal values & syntax\nInitial:initial value\nApplies to:elements this property applies to\nInherited:whether the property is inherited\nPercentages:how percentage values are interpreted\nMedia:which media groups the property applies to\nComputed value:how to compute the computed value\n\n1.4.2.1 Value\n\nThis part specifies the set of valid values for the property whose\nname is ['property-name'](about.html#propdef-property-name). A property\nvalue can have one or more components. Component value types are designated\nin several ways:\n\n keyword values (e.g., auto,\ndisc, etc.)\n\n basic data types, which appear between \"<\" and \">\" (e.g.,\n<length>, <percentage>, etc.). In the electronic version\nof the document, each instance of a basic data type links to its\ndefinition.\n\n types that have the same range of values as a property bearing\nthe same name (e.g., <'border-width'>\n<'background-attachment'>, etc.). In this case, the type name\nis the property name (complete with quotes) between \"<\" and \">\"\n(e.g., <'border-width'>). Such a type does not\ninclude the value 'inherit'. In the electronic version of the\ndocument, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the\ncorresponding property definition.\n\n non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property. In this\ncase, the non-terminal name appears between \"<\" and \">\", as in\n<border-width>. Notice the distinction between\n<border-width> and <'border-width'>; the latter is defined\nin terms of the former. The definition of a non-terminal is located\nnear its first appearance in the specification. In the electronic\nversion of the document, each instance of this type of value links to\nthe corresponding value definition.\n\nOther words in these definitions are keywords that must appear\nliterally, without quotes (e.g., red). The slash (/) and the comma (,)\nmust also appear literally.\n\nComponent values may be arranged into property values as follows:\n\nSeveral juxtaposed words mean that all of them must occur, in the\ngiven order.\nA bar (|) separates two or more alternatives: \nexactly one of them must occur.\nA double bar (||) separates\ntwo or more options: one or more of them must occur, in any order.\nA double ampersand (&&) separates two or more components, all of which\nmust occur, in any order.\nBrackets ([ ]) are for grouping. \n\nJuxtaposition is stronger than the double ampersand, the double\nampersand is stronger than the double bar, and the double bar\nis stronger than the bar. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:\n\n```\n\n a b | c || d && e f\n [ a b ] | [ c || [ d && [ e f ]]]\n\n```\n\n Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of\nthe following modifiers:\n\n \n\n \n An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group\n occurs zero or more times.\n\n \n A plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group \n occurs one or more times.\n\n \n A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word, or\n group is optional.\n\n \n A pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the\n preceding type, word, or group occurs at least A and at most\n B times.\n \n\nThe following examples illustrate different value types:\n\n Value: N | NW | NE\n Value: [ <length> | thick | thin ]{1,4}\n Value: [<family-name> , ]* <family-name>\n Value: <uri>? <color> [ / <color> ]?\n Value: <uri> || <color>\n Value: inset? && [ <length>{2,4} && <color>? ]\n\nComponent values are specified in terms of tokens, as described in [Appendix G.2](grammar.html#scanner). As the grammar allows spaces\nbetween tokens in the components of the `expr` production,\nspaces may appear between tokens in property values.\n\nNote: In many cases, spaces will in fact be\nrequired between tokens in order to distinguish them from\neach other. For example, the value '1em2em' would be parsed as a\nsingle `DIMEN` token with the number '1' and the identifier\n'em2em', which is an invalid unit. In this case, a space would be\nrequired before the '2' to get this parsed as the two lengths '1em'\nand '2em'.\n\n1.4.2.2 Initial\n\nThis part specifies the property's initial value. Please consult\nthe section on [the cascade](cascade.html) for information\nabout the interaction between style sheet-specified, inherited, and\ninitial property values.\n\n1.4.2.3 Applies to\n\nThis part lists the elements to which the property applies. All\nelements are considered to have all properties, but some properties\nhave no rendering effect on some types of elements. For example, the ['clear'](visuren.html#propdef-clear) property only affects block-level elements.\n\n1.4.2.4 Inherited\n\nThis part indicates whether the value of the property is inherited\nfrom an ancestor element. Please consult the section on [the cascade](cascade.html) for information about the\ninteraction between style sheet-specified, inherited, and initial\nproperty values.\n\n1.4.2.5 Percentage values\n\nThis part indicates how percentages should be interpreted, if they occur in\nthe value of the property. If \"N/A\" appears here, it means that the\nproperty does not accept percentages in its values.\n\n1.4.2.6 Media groups\n\nThis part indicates the [media\ngroups](media.html#media-groups) to which the property applies. Information about media\ngroups is non-normative.\n\n1.4.2.7 Computed value\n\nThis part describes the computed value for the property. See the\nsection on [computed values](cascade.html#computed-value)\nfor how this definition is used.",
